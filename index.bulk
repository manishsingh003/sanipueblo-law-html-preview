{"body": "Pueblo de San Ildefonso Code. 2.2.4.010 Findings (a) The Pueblo de San Ildefonso (\"Pueblo\") is a sovereign and self-governing Tribe, recognized as such by the United States of America, with the authority to govern its people, lands and other resources. (b) The U.S. Congress is deliberating on the nature of food and agriculture policy for the nation and the world, as it must reauthorize the multi-year Farm Bill in 2018 which governs all farm programs, rural development, and nutrition initiatives within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. (c) Agriculture is among the largest economic development industries in Indian Country, providing $3.4 billion per year; and the policies that provide the framework for Indian Country's agriculture production constitute a large portion of the Farm Bill. (d) An overwhelming majority of the land throughout Indian Country is involved in agriculture production and many tribal citizens live in rural areas and communities where the cost of building or repairing basic infrastructure systems are often prohibitively high, and the 2018 Farm Bill will provide an authorization of federal funding for rural infrastructure initiatives. (e) Tribal citizens and members in rural areas are often afflicted by poverty of place, wherein they are unable to find suitable employment to provide adequate income that supports good nutrition for their families; and thus, may rely on federal nutrition programs authorized in the Farm Bill. (f) Even with the great strides made for Indian Country agriculture in previous Farm Bill negotiations, going virtually unmentioned in the 1990s to many thoughtful provisions scattered across all Titles, the $3.4 billion generated annually through Indian agricultural efforts is still more than 99 percent raw commodities, instead of the healthy, local, economically beneficial, and nutritious food needed in Indian Country communities and rural areas. (g) The 2018 Farm Bill negotiations, resulting policies, and funding must continue to include and incorporate perspectives from Indian Country to afford parity, opportunity, and consistency under the federal food and agriculture laws, policies, and programs. (h) Improving programs and funding for Indian Country will help to ensure Tribal governments have the ability to establish long-term plans and goals for their communities and the surrounding rural communities, and help Native farmers and ranchers continue to grow their food businesses and build tribal food systems to support our economies and communities. (i) The 2018 Farm Bill effort being promoted by the Native Farm Bill Coalition is the best opportunity in decades for Indian Country to effectively create positive and truly relevant change in federal agriculture policy to enhance the development of Indian agriculture beyond raw commodities, support infrastructure, research, and education in tribal communities, and improve federal food nutrition programs in Indian Country while providing tribal governments the authority manage these programs.

{"body": "Pueblo de San Ildefonso Code. 2.3.8.030 Findings The Council hereby finds and declares that: (a) The Pueblo of Jemez has filed a lawsuit against the United States in a case captioned Pueblo of Jemez v. United States of America , No. 12-cv-0800 RB/SMV (the \"Jemez Lawsuit\"), asking the United States District Court to declare that the Pueblo of Jemez has the exclusive right to use, occupy and possess certain lands in the Valles Caldera based on the Pueblo of Jemez's continuing aboriginal Indian title to those lands, and asking the court to quiet the Pueblo's aboriginal Indian title to the lands. (b) The Pueblo of Jemez has continuously used and occupied its aboriginal lands in the Jemez Mountains, including the area now encompassed by the Valles Caldera National Preserve, for traditional and nontraditional purposes pursuant to the Pueblo's aboriginal Indian title from time immemorial to the present. (c) In 1860 the United States Congress authorized the heirs of Luis Maria Cabeza de Baca to select lands within the then New Mexico Territory in settlement of the heirs' Spanish land grant claim in the vicinity of Las Vegas, New Mexico. (d) The United States and the Pueblo of Santa Clara purchased the 1860 American land grant title to the Baca Location No. 1 from the Dunnigan Family on July 25, 2000 to create the Valles Caldera National Preserve and to add lands to the Santa Clara Reservation. (e) At all times the lands aboriginally used by the Pueblo de San Ildefonso within the Valles Caldera National Preserve have remained subject to the valid aboriginal Indian title of the Pueblo of Jemez, which title has never been abandoned or terminated. (f) It is not customary for the family of Pueblos, to solve or seek to solve any differences of traditional or cultural matters we might have with other Pueblos using the American court system, but instead rely on traditional and informal agreements between them to address such issues. (g) The Pueblo de San Ildefonso and the Pueblo of Jemez have reached agreement as tribal sovereigns regarding their respective traditional cultural activities and spiritual uses and in particular, on arrangements as regards the traditional cultural activities and spiritual uses of the Pueblo de San Ildefonso within the Valles Caldera. (h) The Pueblo de San Ildefonso does not need to be a party to the Jemez Lawsuit against the United States to protect its interests. (i) The Court can accord complete relief among existing parties without the Pueblo de San Ildefonso being a party to the Jemez Lawsuit. (j) The United States, both as a party defendant and as the trustee owing fiduciary obligations to the Pueblo people, should not be allowed to pit one Pueblo against another to avoid addressing the aboriginal title of the Pueblo of Jemez to the lands at issue in the Jemez Lawsuit. (k) The United States recently announced its support of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and Article 26, paragraph 1 of the Declaration states that \"indigenous peoples have the right to the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired.\" (l) The Pueblo de San Ildefonso is not so situated that disposing of the Jemez Lawsuit without the Pueblo de San Ildefonso being in the lawsuit may or would, as a practical matter, impair or impede our ability to protect any interest the Pueblo de San Ildefonso has. (m) The Pueblo de San Ildefonso staying out of the lawsuit would not leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of any interest our Pueblo has or might have. (n) Equity and good conscience confirm that the Jemez Lawsuit should continue without the Pueblo de San Ildefonso's participation. (o) A judgment rendered in the absence of the Pueblo de San Ildefonso would not prejudice the Pueblo or the existing parties. (p) Prejudice to the Pueblo de San Ildefonso by entry of a judgment in its absence can be lessened or avoided by means other than joining our Pueblo as a party. (q) A judgment entered in the absence of the Pueblo de San Ildefonso would be adequate as the Pueblo has an adequate remedy based on the agreements heretofore reached with the Pueblo of Jemez, and the Pueblo of Jemez has by resolution formally recognized its duty to honor those agreements with the Pueblo through traditional methods with the Pueblo of Jemez.

(b) Pursuant to the Santa Fe Indian School Act, 114 Stat. 2868, (2000), the Santa Fe Indian School Trust Lands consisting of approximately 115 acres of land, which includes the SFIS, were taken into trust by the U.S. for the benefit of the 19 Pueblos. (c) In 2004, the Pueblo de San Ildefonso, as a joint owner of the SFIS Trust Lands, delegated its authority on all matters related to the governance, operation and administration of the SFIS Trust Lands to the SFIS, Inc. and its Board of Trustees, the entity also responsible for educational functions of the Santa Fe Indian School. (d) In 2010, out of concern that the SFIS, Inc. was focusing on the development of the SFIS Trust Lands rather than on the educational mission of the SFIS, the Pueblo Council rescinded its 2004 resolution that granted broad governance authority to the SFIS Board of Trustees, and by its 2010 resolution, limited the delegation of Pueblo's governance authority to SFIS, Inc. (e) In 2012, the Governors continued to raise concerns that economic development and governance of the SFIS Trust Lands was taking priority over education, and the SFIS Inc. Board of Trustees committed to the separation of educational functions of the School and economic development projects on the SFIS Trust Lands, and further committed to work with the 19 Pueblo Governors and their Tribal Councils before proceeding with any change in governance activity. (f) In 2015, at the request of SFIS, Inc., the Pueblo passed Resolution No. SI-R15-015 to grant limited governance authority to the SFIS, Inc. to enter into agreements for emergency response situations and to address specific land management issues since those authorities had been rescinded by the Pueblo in 2010. (g) In 2016, after a thorough evaluation of the need to separate governance authority for the SFIS Trust Lands and the educational authority for the SFIS, and at the request of SFIS, Inc., the Pueblo passed Resolution No. SI-R16-005 which rescinded its two prior resolutions, SI-R10-040 and SI-R15-015, and delegated the Pueblo's governance authority over the SFIS Trust Lands to the Albuquerque Indian School District (\"AISD\") Governing Council. (h) The Council determined that it was in the best interest of the Pueblo and SFIS to delegate the Pueblo's authority over the SFIS Trust Lands to its Governor when sitting on the AISD Governing Council so that Governors are making governance decisions for the SFIS Trust Lands, thus keeping educational matters separate and allowing the Board of Trustees to focus on the educational and operational activities of the SFIS. (i) All of the 19 Pueblos passed similar resolutions that delegated their Governor the governance authority over the SFIS Trust Lands when sitting as the AISD Governing Council. (j) Despite the directive of this Pueblo's Tribal Council, and the other 18 Pueblo Tribal Councils, to move governance to the AISD Governing Council, the SFIS Board of Trustees took actions that the Council believes are contrary to the directives of this Pueblo's delegation resolution. (k) The Council determines that it is in the best interest of the Pueblo as a joint owner of the SFIS Trust Lands, to now rescind its Resolution No. SI-R16-005, that delegated authority to the AISD Governing Council for the SFIS Trust Lands, and for the Pueblo to reassume and reserve the Pueblo's governance authority over the SFIS Trust Lands.

Investment of the Account(s) shall be diversified as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so. 4. The Council may employ one or more investment managers of varying styles and philosophies to attain the Account(s)'s objectives. 5. Cash is to be employed productively at all times, by investment in short term cash equivalents to provide safety, liquidity and return. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT POLICY 1. Preservation of Capital \u2013 Consistent with their respective investment styles and philosophies, investment managers should make reasonable efforts to preserve capital, understanding that losses may occur. 2. Risk Aversion \u2013 Understanding that risk is present in all types of securities and investment styles, the Council recognizes that some risk is necessary to produce long-term investment results that are sufficient to meet the Investment Account(s)'s objectives. However, the investment managers are to make reasonable efforts to control risk, and will be evaluated regularly to ensure that the risk assumed is commensurate with the given investment style and objectives. 3. Adherence to Investment Discipline \u2013 Investment managers will be expected to adhere to the investment management styles for which they were hired. Managers will be evaluated regularly for adherence to investment discipline. INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES In order to meet its needs, the investment strategy of the Pueblo is to emphasize total return; that is, the aggregate return from capital appreciation and dividend and interest income. SPECIFIC INVESTMENT GOALS Over the investment horizon established in this Statement, it is the goal of the aggregate Investment Account(s) assets to exceed an absolute annualized, return of 10% over a market cycle of 10 years unless the Tribe hires an additional investment manager(s) with a different investment style of investments. The investment goal above is the objective of the aggregate Investment Account(s), and is not meant to be imposed on each investment account (if more than one account is used). The goal of the investment manager, over the investment horizon, shall be to: 1. Meet or exceed the market index, or blended market index, selected and agreed upon by the Investment Committee that most closely corresponds to the style of the investment manager. 2. Display an overall level of risk in the portfolio which is consistent with the risk associated with the benchmark specified above. Risk will be measured by the standard deviation of quarterly returns. Specific investment goals and constraints for each investment manager, if any, shall be incorporated as part of this Statement of Investment Policy. The manager shall receive a written statement outlining his/her specific goals as they differ from those objectives of the entire Investment Account. DEFINITION OF RISK The Council realizes that there are many ways to define risk. The Council believes that any person or organization involved in the process of managing the Pueblo's assets understands how the Pueblo defines risk so that the assets are managed in a manner consistent with the Investment Account(s)'s objectives and investment strategy as defined in this statement of investment policy. The Council defines risk as: The probability of not meeting the Investment Account(s)'s objectives. LIQUIDITY To minimize the possibility of a loss caused by the need to liquidate securities , the Governor will periodically provide investment managers with an estimate of expected net cash flow. The Governor will notify the investment manager in a timely manner, to allow sufficient time for the money manager to build up necessary liquid reserves. The Governor will inform the Council, through the Lt. Governor, of the cash flow need estimate provided to the Investment Manager(s). To maintain the ability to deal with unplanned cash requirements that might arise, the Council prefers that a minimum of 1% of Investment Account(s) assets shall be maintained in cash of cash equivalents, including money market funds or short-term U.S. Treasury bills. MARKETABILITY OF ASSETS The Council requires that all Investment Account(s) assets be invested in liquid securities, defined as securities that can be transacted quickly and efficiently for the Investment Account(s), with minimal impact on market price. INVESTMENT GUIDELINES Allowable Assets 1. Cash Equivalents Treasury Bills Money Market Funds STIF (Short-Term Interest Funds) Certificates of Deposit 2. Equities Common Stocks Convertible Notes and Bonds Convertible Preferred Stocks Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) American Depository Receipts (ADRs) Derivative Investments Derivative securities are defined as synthetic securities whose price and cash flow characteristics are based on the cash flows and price movements of other underlying securities. Most derivative securities are derived from equity of fixed income securities and are packaged in the form of options, futures, CMOS (PAC bonds, IO's, PO's, residual bonds, etc.), and interest rate swaps, among others. The Council feels that many derivative securities are relatively new and therefore have not been observed over multiple economic cycles. Due to this uncertainty, investment in derivative securities shall not be permitted. Stock Exchanges To ensure marketability and liquidity, investment advisors will execute equity transactions through the following exchanges: New York Stock Exchange; American Stock Exchange; NASDAQ over-the-counter market; and the major Canadian Exchanges. Prohibited Assets Prohibited Investments include, but are not limited to the following: 1. Commodities and Futures Contracts 2. Private Placements 3. Options 4. Unlisted Limited Partnerships 5. Venture-Capital Investments 6. Interest-Only (10), Principal-Only (PO), and Residual Tranche CMOS of CDOS 7. Foreign Debt Instruments Prohibited Transactions Prohibited Transactions include, but are not limited to the following: 1. Short Selling 2. Margin Trading Asset Allocation Guidelines Investment Management of the assets of the Pueblo Investment Account(s) shall be in accordance with the following asset allocation guidelines: 1. Aggregate Investment Account(s) Asset Allocation Guidelines (at market value) Asset Class Minimum Maximum Preferred Equities 85% 100% 99% Cash and Equivalents 0% 15% 1% 2. The Council may employ investment managers whose investment disciplines require investment outside the established asset allocation guidelines. However, taken as a component of the aggregate Investment Account(s), such disciplines must fit within the overall asset allocation guidelines established in this Policy. Such investment managers will receive written direction from the Investment Committee regarding specific objectives and guidelines. 3. In the event that the above aggregate asset allocation guidelines are violated, for reasons including but not limited to market price fluctuations, the Investment Committee will instruct the Investment Manager(s) to bring the portfolio(s) into compliance with these guidelines as promptly and prudently as possible. In addition, in the event that any individual Investment Manager's portfolio is in violation with its specific guidelines, for reasons including but not limited to market price fluctuations, the Council expects that the Investment Manager will bring the portfolio into compliance with these guidelines as promptly and prudently as possible without instruction from the Governor or Council. Diversification for Investment Managers It is not necessary or desirable that securities held in the Investment Account(s) represent a cross section of the economy. However, in order to achieve a prudent level of portfolio diversification for the Investment Account(s), the following allocation limitations will be imposed: Equity: Sector of Industry Group allocations is limited to a current market value of 35% of the Account(s). The current market value of any one equity security is limited to 15% of any single segregated manager's portfolio. These allocation limitations pertain to each separately managed portfolio. Guidelines for Cash Equivalents Money Market Funds selected shall contain securities whose credit rating at the absolute minimum would be rated investment grade by Standard and Poor's, and/or Moody's. SELECTION OF INVESTMENT MANAGERS The recommendation of Investment Manager(s) by the Governor and approval by the Council must be based on prudent due diligence procedures. A qualifying investment manager must be a registered investment advisor under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, or a bank or insurance company. The Council requires that each investment manager provide, in writing, acknowledgement of fiduciary responsibility to the Pueblo. INVESTMENT MANAGER PERFORMANCE REVIEW AND EVALUATION Performance reports generated by the Manager(s) shall be compiled at least quarterly and communicated to the Governor, and Council through the Lt. Governor, for review. The investment performance of the total Account(s), as well as each individual manager, will be measured against commonly accepted performance benchmarks. Consideration shall be given to the extent to which the investment results are consistent with the investment objectives, goals and guidelines as set forth in this Statement. The Governor and Council intend to evaluate the portfolio(s) over a 3 year period, but reserve the right to terminate a manager for any reason including the following: 1. Investment performance which is significantly less than anticipated given the discipline employed and the risk parameters established, or unacceptable justification of poor results. 2. Failure to adhere to any aspect of this Statement of Investment Policy, including communication and reporting requirements. 3. Significant qualitative changes to the investment management organization. Investment managers shall be reviewed regularly regarding performance, personnel, strategy, research capabilities, organizational and business matters, and other qualitative factors that may impact their ability to achieve the desired investment results. AMENDMENT The Council may amend this Statement of Investment Policy at any time upon majority vote of the Council, and in accordance with the requirements of the Agreement. PUEBLO DE SAN ILDEFONSO ASSET APPRECIATION (LONG-TERM) INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO SPENDING POLICY In order to allow for growth of the portfolio as well as preservation of principal, none of the portfolio's assets shall be used for operations or other expenses.

Preservation of Capital \u2013 Consistent with their respective investment styles and philosophies, investment managers should make reasonable efforts to preserve capital, understanding that losses may occur. 2. Risk Aversion \u2013 Understanding that risk is present in all types of securities and investment styles, the Council recognizes that some risk is necessary to produce long-term investment results that are sufficient to meet the Investment Account(s)'s objectives. However, the investment managers are to make reasonable efforts to control risk, and will be evaluated regularly to ensure that the risk assumed is commensurate with the given investment style and objectives. 3. Adherence to Investment Discipline \u2013 Investment managers will be expected to adhere to the investment management styles for which they were hired. Managers will be evaluated regularly for adherence to investment discipline. INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES In order to meet its needs, the investment strategy of the Pueblo is to emphasize total return; that is, the aggregate return from capital appreciation and dividend and interest income. SPECIFIC INVESTMENT GOALS Over the investment horizon established in this Statement, it is the goal of the aggregate Investment Account(s) assets to exceed an absolute annualized, return of 5%, over a market cycle of 5 years unless the Tribe hires an additional investment manager(s) with a different investment style of investments. The investment goal above is the objective of the aggregate Investment Account(s), and is not meant to be imposed on each investment account (if more than one account is used). The goal of the investment manager, over the investment horizon, shall be to: 1. Meet or exceed the market index, or blended market index, selected and agreed upon by the Investment Committee that most closely corresponds to the style of the investment manager. 2. Display an overall level of risk in the portfolio which is consistent with the risk associated with the benchmark specified above. Risk will be measured by the standard deviation of quarterly returns. Specific investment goals and constraints for each investment manager, if any, shall be incorporated as part of this Statement of Investment Policy. The manager shall receive a written statement outlining his/her specific goals as they differ from those objectives of the entire Investment Account. DEFINITION OF RISK The Council realizes that there are many ways to define risk. The Council believes that any person or organization involved in the process of managing the Pueblo's assets understands how the Pueblo defines risk so that the assets are managed in a manner consistent with the Investment Account(s)'s objectives and investment strategy as defined in this statement of investment policy. The Council defines risk as: The probability of not meeting the Investment Account(s)'s objectives. LIQUIDITY To minimize the possibility of a loss caused by the need to liquidate securities , the Governor will periodically provide investment managers with an estimate of expected net cash flow. The Governor will notify the investment manager in a timely manner, to allow sufficient time for the money manager to build up necessary liquid reserves. The Governor will inform the Council through the Lt. Governor, of the cash flow need estimate provided to the Investment Manager(s). To maintain the ability to deal with unplanned cash requirements that might arise, the Council prefers that a minimum of 1% of Investment Account(s) assets shall be maintained in cash of cash equivalents, including money market funds or short-term U.S. Treasury bills. MARKETABILITY OF ASSETS The Council requires that all Investment Account(s) assets be invested in liquid securities, defined as securities that can be transacted quickly and efficiently for the Investment Account(s), with minimal impact on market price. INVESTMENT GUIDELINES Allowable Assets 1. Cash Equivalents Treasury Bills Money Market Funds STIF (Short-Term Interest Funds) Certificates of Deposit 2. Equities Common Stocks Convertible Notes and Bonds Convertible Preferred Stocks Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) American Depository Receipts (ADRs) Derivative Investments Derivative securities are defined as synthetic securities whose price and cash flow characteristics are based on the cash flows and price movements of other underlying securities. Most derivative securities are derived from equity of fixed income securities and are packaged in the form of options, futures, CMOS (PAC bonds, IO's, PO's, residual bonds, etc.), and interest rate swaps, among others. The Council feels that many derivative securities are relatively new and therefore have not been observed over multiple economic cycles. Due to this uncertainty, investment in derivative securities shall not be permitted. Stock Exchanges To ensure marketability and liquidity, investment advisors will execute equity transactions through the following exchanges: New York Stock Exchange; American Stock Exchange; NASDAQ over-the-counter market; and the major Canadian Exchanges. Prohibited Assets Prohibited Investments include, but are not limited to the following: 1. Commodities and Futures Contracts 2. Private Placements 3. Options 4. Unlisted Limited Partnerships 5. Venture-Capital Investments 6. Interest-Only (10), Principal-Only (PO), and Residual Tranche CMOS of CDOS 7. Foreign Debt Instruments Prohibited Transactions Prohibited Transactions include, but are not limited to the following: 1. Short Selling 2. Margin Trading Asset Allocation Guidelines Investment Management of the assets of the Pueblo Investment Account(s) shall be in accordance with the following asset allocation guidelines: 1. Aggregate Investment Account(s) Asset Allocation Guidelines (at market value) Asset Class Minimum Maximum Preferred Equities 85% 100% 99% Cash and Equivalents 0% 15% 1% 2. The Council may employ investment managers whose investment disciplines require investment outside the established asset allocation guidelines. However, taken as a component of the aggregate Investment Account(s), such disciplines must fit within the overall asset allocation guidelines established in this Policy. Such investment managers will receive written direction from the Investment Committee regarding specific objectives and guidelines. 3. In the event that the above aggregate asset allocation guidelines are violated, for reasons including but not limited to market price fluctuations, the Investment Committee will instruct the Investment Manager(s) to bring the portfolio(s) into compliance with these guidelines as promptly and prudently as possible. In addition, in the event that any individual Investment Manager's portfolio is in violation with its specific guidelines, for reasons including but not limited to market price fluctuations, the Council expects that the Investment Manager will bring the portfolio into compliance with these guidelines as promptly and prudently as possible without instruction from the Governor or Council. Diversification for Investment Managers It is not necessary or desirable that securities held in the Investment Account(s) represent a cross section of the economy. However, in order to achieve a prudent level of portfolio diversification for the Investment Account(s), the following allocation limitations will be imposed: Equity: Sector of Industry Group allocations is limited to a current market value of 35% of the Account(s). The current market value of any one equity security is limited to 15% of any single segregated manager's portfolio. These allocation limitations pertain to each separately managed portfolio. Guidelines for Cash Equivalents Money Market Funds selected shall contain securities whose credit rating at the absolute minimum would be rated investment grade by Standard and Poor's, and/or Moody's. SELECTION OF INVESTMENT MANAGERS The recommendation of Investment Manager(s) by the Governor and approval by the Council must be based on prudent due diligence procedures. A qualifying investment manager must be a registered investment advisor under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, or a bank or insurance company. The Council requires that each investment manager provide, in writing, acknowledgement of fiduciary responsibility to the Pueblo. INVESTMENT MANAGER PERFORMANCE REVIEW AND EVALUATION Performance reports generated by the Manager(s) shall be compiled at least quarterly and communicated to the Governor, and Council through the Lt. Governor, for review. The investment performance of the total Account(s), as well as each individual manager, will be measured against commonly accepted performance benchmarks. Consideration shall be given to the extent to which the investment results are consistent with the investment objectives, goals and guidelines as set forth in this Statement. The Governor and Council intend to evaluate the portfolio(s) over a 3 year period, but reserve the right to terminate a manager for any reason including the following: 1. Investment performance which is significantly less than anticipated given the discipline employed and the risk parameters established, or unacceptable justification of poor results. 2. Failure to adhere to any aspect of this Statement of Investment Policy, including communication and reporting requirements. 3. Significant qualitative changes to the investment management organization. Investment managers shall be reviewed regularly regarding performance, personnel, strategy, research capabilities, organizational and business matters, and other qualitative factors that may impact their ability to achieve the desired investment results. AMENDMENT The Council may amend this Statement of Investment Policy at any time upon majority vote of the Council, and in accordance with the requirements of the Agreement.

(b) The goals of BOR are Support Channel Sustainability, Protect Riverside Infrastructure and Resources, Be Ecosystem Compatible and Provide Effective Water Delivery. (c) In about year 2006 the Pueblo identified an area of concern north of the fishing pond by which the Rio Grande River flow was migrating east causing an abrupt bend and erosion. (d) In spring 2007 as erosion progressed, BOR installed eight rock vanes to reduce forces and redirect flows away from the bank. (e) The Spring 2009 runoff eroded the vegetated area upstream of the rock vanes which resulted in up to 80 feet of lost bankline. (f) Due to time constraints associated with designing and securing permits for an extensive bank protection method, a temporary fix was implemented in 2010 by installing riprap in a trench reventment parallel to the east bankline and a windrow above the ground along the diagonal vane to prevent flanking of the buried vanes. (g) The temporary fix was to protect the fishing pond and the east bankline for at least 1-2 spring runoff flow events until the design, selection, and construction of a more extensive bank stabilization project is completed. (h) The erosion of bankline and bend of river continues and is now a threat to the integrity of the fishing pond. (i) The BOR and the Pueblo have been working collaboratively to develop alternatives and methods to protect tribal land and property. (j) The BOR and the Pueblo have come to a consensus on selecting an alternative which will be in two phases; Phase I will be on the east side of river, north of fishing pond and Phase II will be on the west side of river, northwest of fishing pond. (k) The BOR requests approval from the Pueblo de San Ildefonso to proceed with the project design, environmental and lands compliances, and construction and maintenance of project.

(d) The Council after due consideration approved the Revised Agreement, the Waivers and the CSSIA on behalf of the Pueblo in Resolution No. SI-R12-035. (e) Section 3.4 of the CSSIA, \"Pueblo de San Ildefonso Considerations\" in subsection (b) states \"the diversion and connected facilities shall be located as specified by the Pueblo de San Ildefonso, consistent with the Engineering Report, or other suitable alternatives. (f) The Engineering Report location for the Water Treatment Plant did not adequately consider cultural and safety concerns of the Pueblo. (g) The Bureau of Reclamation has issued a draft river diversion and water treatment plant location options binder for the Pojoaque Basin Regional Water System project. (h) The Council received a presentation from the Bureau of Reclamation and its water committee concerning the ten options for diversion and water treatment. (i) Option 9 calls for a diversion through \"Radial Galleries,\" sometimes called Ranney Wells or Horizontal Collector Wells, on the east side of the Rio Grande and a water treatment plant to be located adjacent to Highway 101D, North of Highway 502, near the Pueblo's eastern boundary. (j) Option 9 minimizes injury or risk to cultural resources at the Pueblo resulting from construction of water treatment plant for the Regional Water System, and reduces expected operating cost by use of \"radial galleries\" which minimize conveyance of sediment-laden water to the treatment plant.

{"body": "Pueblo de San Ildefonso Code. 11.2.6.010 Findings (a) On January 26, 2006, an amendment to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) reduced the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for arsenic from 50 to 10 parts per billion (ppb). (b) The Pajaritio water system, consisting of two wells, has an arsenic concentration range between 15 and 22 ppb and subsequently does not comply with the amended MCL. (c) The Pueblo requested and has been granted and exemption that gives the Pueblo until January 2015 to bring the Pajaritio water system into compliance with the SDWA. (d) In 2007, the Pueblo received and will administer a direct grant under the EPA in the amount of $783,000, which will be allocated towards drilling a 1,200 ft deep well in Pajarito ($650,000) and renovating existing Main Village Wells #1 and #2 ($133,000). (e) On April 6, 2010, Indian Health Services (IHS) presented to the Tribal Council and recommended reducing MCL levels by developing of a new well on the East side of the Rio Grande and pumping water to Pajarito via boring locations under the Rio Grande. (f) In September 2010, the Pueblo requested assistance from IHS to engineer and oversee construction of video inspection, pump testing, and water quality testing of Main Village Wells #1 and #2. (g) The Pueblo and IHS entered into a Memorandum of Agreement under IHS Project, AL 10-110 for this scope of work. (h) In March 2011, IHS helped the Pueblo secure an additional $800,000 from EPA SWDA funding to construct a new well, pumphouse, booster station, and water main extension to Pajarito under the Rio Grande through IHS project AL 11-115. (i) Based on video inspection, pump testing, and water quality testing of Main Village Wells #1 and #2 (Old and New Community Wells), completed in March 2011, it was determined that these wells should not be used and a new community well should be drilled. (j) In October 2011, IHS utilized their government contract with Bohannan Huston, Inc. to have a hydrogeological study performed to site the best location for a new community well. (k) The hydrogeological study recommended drilling a new exploratory well and production well approximately 850 feet north of the existing Black Mesa Well, which will increase water system reliability and provide sufficient water supply for both the Main Village and Pajarito communities. (l) Well construction began in July 2012 and is now nearly complete, IHS is sizing the new well pump, and the hydrogeologist has completed a 95% draft report on the well. (m) The EPA has indicated that the direct grant ($783,000) funds will expire on October 31, 2013 and that if they are not spent, EPA will have to cancel the grant and the remaining funds will be used for a different project. (n) IHS is working with the Pueblo and the EPA to try to spend as much of the grant direct funds as possible before they expire. (o) IHS is currently designing a new pumphouse near the newly drilled Black Mesa Well #2, a new raw water main from the Black Mesa Well #1 to the new pumphouse, a water main extension from the new pumphouse to connect to the existing water system, a new solenoid valve, a new booster station, a water main estension from the new booster station to Pajarito existing water system which will include boring under the Rio Grande, and water system controls. (p) To accomplish this scope of work, IHS will also be working on an environmental assessment for the water main extension to Pajarito with the boring under the Rio Grande and performing a geotechnical investigation along the water main alignment to Pajarito, especially at the boring location under the Rio Grande. (q) The Tribal Council finds that it is in the best interest of the Pueblo to support IHS completing this scope of work.

(k) Each Pueblo's water representatives agreed to recommend to the respective Tribal Councils approval of the attached Pueblo Economic Development water Agreement as documented by NPTWRA Resolution No. 2013-004. (l) Action by the individual Tribal Councils of the Pueblos of Nambe, Pojoaque, San Ildefonso, and Tesuque, is needed in order to submit the Pueblo Economic Development Water Agreement to the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for approval and allocation of funds appropriated in the Act for access by the Pueblo through the Office of Special Trustee (OST). (m) Each Pueblo's share of the Fund, plus indexing increases, may be used in coordination with work by the Bureau of Reclamation on the Pojoaque Basin Regional Water System once the Secretary of the Interior or designee determines that \"any activity...is more cost effective when implemented in conjunction with the construction of the Regional Water System\" (Section 615(c)(7)(ii)). (n) The Pueblo wishes to access those funds as soon as possible in order to have water infrastructure improvements made in conjunction with the design, environmental review, and construction of the Pojoaque Basin Regional Water System. (o) The Pueblo by Council Resolution No. SI-R13-016 on May 7, 2013 approved a version of the Pueblo Economic Development Water Agreement. (p) The United States Office of Special Trustee (OST) requested revisions to the Agreement approved by the Tribal Council. (q) The version of the Pueblo Economic Development Water Agreement attached to this resolution contains the OST revisions. (r) The OST changes do not affect the allocation of money previously approved by the Pueblo. (s) Approval of the attached Pueblo Economic Development Water Agreement is in the best interest of this Pueblo.

(i) The Pueblo de San Ildefonso Tribal Council, by Resolution No. SI-R13-040 in 2013, designated Option 9 \"East Radial Gallery and WTP (Water Treatment Plant) near Highway 101(D)\" as its selected option for the locations of the surface water diversion and water treatment plant for the Pojoaque Basin Regional Water System Project. (j) Reclamation has developed another option for collecting water from the Rio Grande using an infiltration type of water collection system in the space approved by the Pueblo involving large perforated pipes running parallel with the Rio Grande. (k) Reclamation needs Pueblo approval for disposal of water coming from both (a) the pilot water treatment plant and (b) up to ten test holes connected with determining the best locations for a possible infiltration system. (l) Water from the pilot water treatment plant, in an amount of up to 72,000 gallons (0.2 acre-feet) per day, will be treated to drinking water standards, and Reclamation requests to deliver this water for Pueblo irrigation purposes during some of the summer months of the current irrigation season. (m) The water produced will be delivered by water truck to locations (acequias) specified by the Pueblo for irrigation. (n) The testing will generate up to 100 gallons of water per minute for at least 2 hours per hold or approximately 12,000 gallons per hole. (o) The water generated will be discharged on the ground near each test hole. (p) The amount of water to be produced from initial tests of the holes is similar to a rainfall and will percolate into the soil.

Septic tanks discharge an effluent which is rich in nitrogen-based compounds and other contaminants into the ground which could eventually reach the water supply aquifer. In addition, as population increases in the Pueblo in the future, increased contamination is highly likely unless actions are taken now; (c) The Pueblo was awarded funding through the New Mexico Tribal Infrastructure Fund (TIF) to complete a Preliminary Engineering Report (PER) and a final design for wastewater infrastructure within the exterior boundaries of the Pueblo de San Ildefonso; (d) The firm of Souder, Miller &amp; Associates (SMA) was contracted to complete the PER and final design for wastewater infrastructure for the Pueblo with a completion date of December 1, 2016; (e) In September 2016, SMA prepared a \"draft\" PER that evaluated the need for developing additional wastewater infrastructure, any necessary wastewater system improvements, and alternatives to address wastewater utility needs for the Pueblo de San Ildefonso and submitted the PER to Council for review and comment; (f) The PER provided four (4) Alternatives and is based on meeting the needs of the Pueblo over a 20-year planning period spanning from 2016 to 2036.

The priority of this right is time immemorial. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, 288 AFY of this right are designated as Existing Basin Use Rights and 958 AFY are designated as Future Basin Use Rights (2) the Pueblo de San Ildefonso has the Reserved Right under federal law for the San Ildefonso Eastern Reservation to consumptively use the waters of the Pojoaque Basin for grazing purposes on the Reservation in an amount not exceed 4.82 AFY. The priority of this right is 1939.\" (d) The Pueblo's first priority water rights shall be administered consistent with the terms of the Settlement Agreement entered into by the Pueblo along with seven other governments on March 14, 2013; (e) The federal court order dated April 13, 1984 stated the Pueblos \"\u2026will be allowed to challenge priorities [for non-Indians] equal to or senior to the Pueblos' priorities at a later date after the Pueblos' priorities are determined.\"; (f) The court order dated August 17, 1992 stated \"\u2026the Pueblos will have standing in the inter se proceeding any time their water right is affected, which is to say, any time they risk a diminution in their water right or a change in priority.\"; (g) The court order entered September 9, 2016 stated \"In addition to the extent consistent with the prior orders of the court and the Settlement Agreement, the Pueblos and the United States may file objections to non-Pueblo surface water priorities\u2026.

The court halted consideration of those challenges, stating that the Pueblos could not challenge rights with priority junior to the Pueblos; (k) The court has determined in the Decree of Pueblo Water Rights that the Pueblo water rights in the Pojoaque Basin are senior to all non-Indian water rights; \"prior orders of the court\" show the Pueblo water rights may be enforced against junior non-Indian water rights by means of a priority call, rather than through inter se challenges; (l) Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act of 2010 requires entry of a Final Decree of all water rights in the Aamodt case no later than September, 2017; (m) Inter Se challenges filed at this time could jeopardize the ability of the court to enter a final decree in the Aamodt case within the time limit imposed by Congress; (n) The Pueblo's water rights team has considered this issue and recommends that the Tribal Council enact this resolution.

{"body": "Pueblo de San Ildefonso Code. 11.2.17.050 Findings The Council hereby finds and declares that: (a) The Pueblo de San Ildefonso is a party in the federal water adjudication case of State v. Aamodt . (b) In 2010, the United States enacted the Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act, as part of the Claims Resolution Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 11-291, Title VI, \u00a7\u00a7 601-626, 124 Stat. 3064, 3134-56 (2010), which was signed into law by the President on December 8, 2010 (\"Settlement Act\" or \"Act\"). (c) The parties revised the Settlement Agreement (April 19, 2012) (\"Revised Agreement\") to reflect the terms of the Settlement Act, prepared Waivers consistent with the Act and completed the Cost Sharing and System Integration Agreement (\"CSSIA\") as required by the Act. (d) The Council after due consideration approved the Revised Agreement, the Waivers and the CSSIA on behalf of the Pueblo in Resolution NO. SI-R12-035. (e) The four Pueblos of Namb\u00e9, Pojoaque, San Ildefonso and Tesuque that are parties to the Aamodt case signed the Settlement Agreement conformed to the Act on March 14, 2013, together with the other four governments affected by the Act. (f) Section 9.5 of the Settlement Agreement requires the four Pueblos and Santa Fe County (\"County\") to create the Pojoaque Basin Regional Water Authority (\"Regional Water Authority\") prior to Entry of the Final Decree in accordance with the provisions of the Settlement Agreement and the August 27, 2009 Cost-Sharing and System Integration Agreement (Cost-Sharing Agreement) signed by the United States, the State, the four Pueblos, the County, and the City. (g) Since 2013, the four Pueblos negotiated with the County to develop terms for a JPA to establish a Regional Water Authority to operate the Pojoaque Basin Regional Water System which the United States is building as required by the Settlement Act. (h) The Pueblo had previously approved a form of the JPA which was later revised as a result of on-going negotiations between the parties. (i) The Pueblo de San Ildefonso, as one of the four NPTWRA Pueblos, negotiated in good faith certain terms with Santa Fe County representatives in April 2016, but the County later disagreed with the negotiated terms, and after several meetings with the four Pueblos, including several public meetings, proposed terms different than those previously negotiated with the NPTWRA Pueblos. Despite the Pueblos' opposition, Santa Fe County adopted its proposed terms at a meeting on December 13, 2016. (j) On December 13, 2016, Santa Fe County by Resolution No. 2016-146 approved the form of the JPA. (k) Article 19(H) of the proposed JPA requires the respective Pueblo and County governing bodies to adopt resolutions approving the JPA, \"including the limited waiver of sovereign immunity provided therein.\" (l) Action on the JPA by the individual Tribal Councils of the Pueblos of Namb\u00e9, Pojoaque, San Ildefonso, and Tesuque on the JPA is needed in order to create the Regional Water Authority. (m) The Council, having reviewed a form of the Joint Powers Agreement, and despite the concern about the changed terms by Santa Fe County, finds approval of the Joint Powers Agreement, which includes a limited waiver of the Pueblo's sovereign immunity, is in the best interest of this Pueblo and in the interest of moving the Aamodt Settlement forward.

(b) As part of the implementation of the Aamodt Settlement, a regional water system will be constructed by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (\"BOR\"), with the primary intake and treatment facilities for the system being located on Pueblo lands. (c) On December 22, 2016, BOR requested that the Pueblo approve a location for the water treatment plant and identified three (3) potential locations as follows: (1) 101D East \u2013 located on the east side of 101D south of electric substation (Location A); (2) 101 West \u2013 located on the west side of 101D across from the electric substation (Location B); (3) Highway 502 \u2013 located at the northwest side of intersection of Highway 502 and 101D (Location C). (d) The Council had previously authorized a site, identified herein as Location A, as the preferred site pursuant to Council Resolution SI-R13-005. (e) In its December 22, 2016 letter, the BOR identified issues with the locations as summarized follows: (1) Location A lies within a flood zone, is restrictive in size, will require relocation of power poles and substantial fill material to level the site. (2) Location B will require relocation of some power poles and will require excavation of the hill at the site. (3) Location C is the preferred location of BOR because it requires no excavation or relocation of power poles. (f) Traditional leaders of the Pueblo have been informed of BOR's recommendation and have toured the potential locations, along with several Council Representatives. (g) In consultation with the Traditional leaders, the Council has evaluated all of the locations and determined that: (1) Location C is not acceptable for the treatment plant site because it will limit the Pueblo's future economic development at that location, but may be used as a temporary construction staging area for the regional water system; and (2) Location A is not acceptable because it lies within a flood zone and due to other restrictions; and (3) Location B is the most favorable location because of the limitations of the other proposed sites, and that excavated material from Location B can be sold for use in the construction of the regional water system. (h) The Council has determined that it is in the best interest of the Pueblo to rescind SI-R13-005 relating to the previous preferred location, and to now approve Location B as the site for the location for the water treatment facility for the Pojoaque Basin Regional Water System.

(d) The Pueblo in cooperation with the State of New Mexico and federal agencies initiated the Natural Resource Trustee Council (\"Trustee Council\") effort for DOE's Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) site. (e) The Pueblo entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (\"initial MOA\") in 2007 to establish the LANL Natural Resource Trustee Council (\"Trustee Council\"). (f) Only tribal, state, and federal governments are authorized to be natural resources trustees for their respective jurisdictions. (g) The Trustee Council members from tribal, state, and federal governments are trustees for natural resources that may have suffered injuries resulting from releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances (including radionuclides) and discharges or threatened discharges of oil, in and from the area of LANL. (h) The purpose of the LANL natural resource damage assessment (NRDA) and restoration (NRDAR) is to identify and restore the service losses caused by LANL which affect the environment in the jurisdictions of each Trustee. (i) The initial MOA expired in 2012, and a second MOA (attached to this Resolution) has been negotiated to continue the Trustee Council work on natural resource damage assessment (NRDA) for another five years with an ability to withdraw by written notice to the co-trustees. (j) The Second MOA provides for a five year term, and allows any party to terminate its participation in the MOA by giving thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other co-trustees. (k) Trustee Council members currently include the Pueblos de San Ildefonso, Jemez and Santa Clara, State through its Office of Natural Resources Trustee, and federal departments of Energy and Agriculture. (l) The Trustee Council has overseen a technical team to perform a pre-assessment screen which confirmed LANL damaged natural resources, and are no completing work on an assessment plan. (m) The natural resource damage assessment and restoration (\"NRDAR\") process will take several years for technical studies to implement the NRDA plan and determine what injury to natural resources occurred, quantify the injuries and lost \"services\", determine the \"pathways' for each hazardous substance, and quantify damages. (n) The Pueblo's location in relation to LANL means numerous pathways for hazardous material from LANL may affect the Pueblo people and resources. (o) The DOE provides financial support for the NRDAR process, including studies required by the Trustee Council's NRDA plan. (p) NRDAR work is separate from DOE's clean up responsibilities; DOE Policy encourages cooperation between the two activities. (q) The Trustee Council has completed work on a natural resource damage assessment (NRDA) plan. (r) The Trustee Council has prioritized studies of \"Pueblo narratives\" and \"Resource characterization for assessment and restoration of Pueblo services\" which require input form the Pueblo and other Pueblo trustees concerning natural resource damage and loss of cultural services suffered by Pueblo members. (s) The NRDA process will provide a basis for estimating the monetary value of damages needed to restore, replace or acquire resources equivalent to the injured natural resources, plus the loss of use and enjoyment of the injured resources. (t) The NRDAR process will also seek to identify projects that will restore cultural services to Pueblo members which have been lost as a result of natural resources damages caused by DOE's LANL facility. (u) After the assessment work, the Trustee Council will develop a plan for restoration, replacement, or acquisition of equivalent resources using money actually available. (v) The Pueblo expects DOE and the Trustee Council to respect the Pueblo's decisions regarding appropriate steps to restore damage and service losses determined in the NRDA studies to be specific to the Pueblo's land and people. (w) The NRDA process does not require giving up any possible claims and Pueblo retains the right to make natural resources damage claims independent of the Trustee Council. (x) Participation in the natural resource damage assessment process as a natural resources trustee, on terms specified in the attached Second Memorandum of Agreement, is in the best interests of the Pueblo.

All Animals, including dogs and cats, four (4) months of age or older must be licensed. Licenses shall be issued by the Animal Control Officer.

(2) An animal subject to licensing under this Section and that is on Pueblo Lands for fourteen (14) days or less is exempt from the licensing requirement of this Section, but the Owner must present a current rabies vaccination before the animal may enter Pueblo Lands. Any Owner who is not able to present this documentation will be ordered to immediately remove the animal from Pueblo Lands. (c) Requirements for License. Before a license may be issued, the Owner must: (1) Pay any applicable license fees; and (2) Present a rabies vaccination certificate or current tag to the Animal Control Officer proving that the animal has been vaccinated with a vaccine licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture as recommended in the then current Compendium of Animal Rabies Control prepared by the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians. The certificate must be signed by a veterinarian or, after the development of a sustainable vaccination program, by the Animal Control Officer. The certificate must state the Owner's name and address, the animal's description, the date of vaccination, the vaccine type, the vaccine manufacturer and lot number and/or serial number, and the date that revaccination is due. If the vaccination was administered by a veterinarian, the form shall also state the veterinarian's name and address. (d) Form of License. Each license issued shall consist of a license receipt and a suitable tag. (1) The license receipt shall state the license fee paid, the name, address and telephone number of the Owner, the date of payment, the date the license was issued and expires, the serial number, a general description including color, sex, name, and breed of the animal, and whether the animal has been neutered or spayed.

Upon request by the Animal Control Officer, an Owner must promptly present its animal's license receipt.

(f) Wearing of Tag by Animal. (1) Every dog or cat must wear its tag on a securely attached collar, halter, or similar device whenever the animal is off the Owner's premises. An animal found without a tag while off its Owner's premises may be considered unlicensed. The burden of proof that the animal is licensed or not required to wear a tag is on the Owner. (2) Temporary Removal of Tag. An animal does not have to wear its tag if wearing a collar, halter, or similar device will worsen a skin condition. In order to avoid citation, the skin condition must be reasonably observable by the Animal Control Officer. (g) Expiration; Renewal. All licenses issued under this Act will expire two years from the date of issuance. A renewal will be issued upon completion of any required forms and payment of any required renewal fee. Extensions for renewal of an expired license may be given in the sole discretion of the Animal Control Officer. (h) Replacement License. An Owner may get a license receipt or tag replaced after the Owner submits an application and pays any applicable replacement fee. The expiration date for the replacement shall be the same date as for the item being replaced. (i) Failure to Pay Fee. Payment of any applicable fee in this Section must be made when due. Payment of an applicable fee after a citation is issued but before a summons to appear is issued does not relieve the Owner from paying any fine ordered by the Courts for failure to pay the fee in a timely manner.

The collar tag shall be securely affixed to the animal's collar, as appropriate, and shall be worn at all times when the animal is not confined within the Owner's or custodian's dwelling unit.

(3) All veterinarians doing business on Pueblo Lands shall provide a copy of any issued certificate of rabies vaccination to the Animal Control Officer. (c) Declaration of Rabies Emergency. When sufficient evidence exists to believe that a rabid or potentially rabid animal is at-large within Pueblo Lands, the Animal Control Officer may undertake any actions necessary to immediately contain and prevent the spread of rabies. This will require the immediate cooperation of other Pueblo officials to abate the emergency situation. The Animal Control Office may issue an emergency rule (which shall become effective upon passage) which may require owners and custodians of animals to keep their animals confined upon their premises unless under leash and under the control of the Owner or custodian so as not to subject their animals to contact with the rabid animal.

(3) If notice is made in writing, the Owner shall immediately and in no event in more than twenty-four (24) hours, contact the Animal Control Officer about the notice. Each subsequent day's failure to make the required contact with the Animal Control Officer after written notice is made shall be considered a separate offense by the Owner.

Upon order by the Animal Control Officer, the owner shall immediately hand over such animal. (3) Such animal shall be confined for a period of no less than one (1) day and not to exceed six (6) months. (h) Quarantine Under Veterinary Control or Impoundment. (1) If the Animal Control Officer determines that such animal cannot be safely and appropriately confined under the Owner's control, the animal may, at the discretion of the Animal Control Officer, be quarantined by containment at a veterinary facility or by impoundment at the community Pound.

The Pueblo Tribal Council is the governing body and has legislative and other responsibilities for the Pueblo in its exercise of its inherent sovereign powers. A primary objective of the Tribal Council is to provide a work environment that is conducive to both personal and professional growth. This Policy is designed to acquaint you with the Pueblo and provide you with information about working conditions, employee benefits, and some of the policies affecting your employment. It describes many of your responsibilities as an employee and outlines the programs developed by the Pueblo to benefit employees. It is your responsibility to read, understand, and comply with all provisions of the Policy. One of our objectives is to provide a work environment that is conducive to both personal and professional growth. No Personnel Policy can anticipate every circumstance or question. Over time, the need may arise and the Pueblo reserves the right to revise, supplement, or rescind any policies as the Tribal Council deems appropriate, in its sole and absolute discretion. Employees will be notified appropriately of such changes. These policies and procedures shall apply to all employees of the Pueblo. DEFINITIONS The following terms are used throughout this Manual: 1. \"Tribal Council\" means the governing body for the Pueblo. This Personnel Policy has been approved and adopted by the Pueblo Tribal Council. In case of conflict between this Personnel Policy and Tribal Ordinances and By-Laws, the Tribal Council will evaluate the conflict and make decision regarding which provision shall prevail. 2. \"Governor\" means the elected official of the Pueblo in charge of all programs, employees, and operations, and the direct supervisor of the Tribal Administrator. 3. \"Tribal Administrator\" means the individual who administers the day-to-day operations, business and fiscal affairs, and other management function associated with the administration of the Pueblo and who supervises all Directors. 4. \"Director\" means the person charged with the management and budget functions of individual departments and/or programs of the Pueblo. 5. \"Supervisor\" means the individual to whom any employee directly reports and receives directions. 6. \"Coordinator\" means an individual responsible for the overall function of the program and provides administrative direction/support and technical assistance to all staff. 7. \"Employee\" means an individual hired to carry out the objectives of the Pueblo, as identified in their job description. 8. \"Pueblo de San Ildefonso\" means a sovereign self-governing Indian Nation recognized by the United States of America Federal Government. 9. \"At-Will\" means an employee is free to resign at any time; and the Pueblo is free to terminate employment at any time, with or without cause. GENERAL EMPLOYMENT POLICIES 101. Nature of Employment Employment with the Pueblo is \"at-will\" so that employment is voluntarily entered into by the employee and the employee is free to resign at any time, with or without cause. Similarly, the Pueblo is free to terminate the employment at any time, with or without cause. Employees may be given the right to pursue grievance procedures. This Policy is not a contract. The policies set forth are not intended to create a contract, nor are they to be construed to constitute contractual obligations, express or implied, to remain employed by the Pueblo. Nor does it guarantee any fixed terms or conditions of employment. Nothing in any policy or work rule of the Pueblo shall alter the at-will employment relationship between the Pueblo and its employees. This Policy is intended to provide employees with a general understanding of employment with the Pueblo. However, this Policy cannot anticipate every situation or answer every question about employment. Therefore, in order to retain necessary flexibility in the administration of policies and procedures, the Pueblo reserves the right to alter, delete, or add to any of the provisions of the Policy and to change, modify, suspend, cancel or interpret any of the personnel policies and practices or employee benefits which are described herein without notice to employees whenever the Tribal Council determines, in its sole discretion, that such action is warranted and without having to give cause or justification or consideration to any employee. These provisions supersede all existing policies and practices and may not be amended or added to without the express written approval of the Pueblo Tribal Council. It is the responsibility of the Tribal Administrator to notify all employees of changes made to the content of the Policy in a timely fashion. 102. Equal Employment Opportunity In order to provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals, employment decisions at the Pueblo will be based on performance, job qualifications, and experience. The Pueblo does not discriminate in employment opportunities or practices on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, ancestry, disability, or any other characteristic protected by law. However, the Pueblo will give preference in employment to qualified American Indians and Pueblo Tribal members as described by the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act and other applicable laws. This policy applies to all employment practices, including recruiting, hiring, evaluation, promotion, transfer, discipline and termination, as well as all forms of employee compensation. All of the Pueblo's policies will be interpreted to permit and promote reasonable accommodation of the disabilities and religious beliefs and practices of otherwise qualified employees and applicants, except where such accommodation causes undue hardship to the Pueblo. The extent of an obligation is determined by the Pueblo of San Ildefonso's needs, financial costs and expense, in conformity with applicable law. Every employee is expected to conform to this policy, to accomplish work in a professional and businesslike manner, and to be courteous to all other employees, contractors, business associates, customers, guests, and visitors at all times. Discrimination against or harassment of any employee or other person because of race, color, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, age, national origin, ancestry or disability is strictly prohibited. 103. Business Ethics and Conduct The successful operation and reputation of the Pueblo is built upon the principles of fair dealing and ethical conduct of our employees. Employees owe a duty to the Pueblo, its community members and the Tribal Council to act in a way that will merit the continued trust and confidence of the public. Employees are expected to conduct themselves in a positive and professional manner so as to promote the best interests of the Pueblo. The Pueblo will comply with all applicable laws and regulations and expects its employees to conduct business in accordance with the letter, spirit, and intent of all applicable laws and regulations and to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct. In general, the use of good judgment, based on high ethical principles, will guide employees with respect to lines of acceptable conduct. If a situation arises where it is difficult to determine the proper course of action, the matter will be referred to the Tribal Administrator who will make a final determination on the issue. Conduct that interferes with operations, discredits, or is offensive the Pueblo, the public, or fellow employees will not be tolerated. 104. Conflicts of Interest Employees have an obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or potential conflicts of interest. Employees are expected, at all times, to act in the best interest of the Pueblo. Transactions with outside firms - must be conducted within a framework established and controlled by the Governor of the Pueblo. Business dealings with outside firms should not result in unusual gains for those firms or employees. Unusual gain refers to bribes, product bonuses, special fringe benefits, unusual price breaks, and other windfalls designed to ultimately benefit the employer, the employee, or both. Plans that could be interpreted to involve unusual gain require specific approval from the Tribal Council. An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when an employee is in a position to influence a decision that may result in a personal gain for that employee or for a relative as a result of the Pueblo's business dealings. However, if employees have any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or leases, it is imperative that they disclose to the Tribal Administrator the existence of any actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards can be established to protect all parties. Personal gain may occur not only in cases where an employee or relative has a significant ownership in a firm with which the Pueblo does business, but also when an employee or relative receives special consideration or unusual gain as a result of any transaction or business dealing. 105. Outside Employment Unless a conflict of interest is created, an employee may hold a job with another organization as long as that employee, first, obtains the written acknowledgment from their Director and, second, continues to satisfactorily perform their job responsibilities with the Pueblo. The second job cannot interfere with the position held with the Pueblo of San Ildefonso. All employees will be judged by the same performance standards and will be subject to the Pueblo's scheduling demands, regardless of any existing outside work requirements. If the Pueblo determines that an employee's outside work interferes with performance or the ability to meet the requirements of the Pueblo, the employee may be asked to terminate the outside employment as a condition of remaining employed by the Pueblo. Outside employment will present a conflict of interest if it has an adverse impact on the Pueblo or otherwise is inconsistent with the provisions of Section 104 Conflicts of Interest. 106. Dress Code Dress, grooming, and personal cleanliness standards contribute to the morale of all employees and affect the business image the Pueblo presents to community members and visitors. Attire should be clean, tasteful, non-offensive and non-revealing. During business hours, employees are expected to present a clean and neat appearance and to dress according to the requirements of their positions. Employees who appear for work inappropriately dressed will be sent home and directed to return to work in proper attire. Under such circumstances, employees will not be compensated for the time away from work. Consult your Director or supervisor if you have questions as to what constitutes appropriate attire. 107. Confidentiality The protection of confidential business information, trade secrets and Tribal information is vital to the interests and the success of the Pueblo. Such confidential information includes, but is not limited to, the following: Personnel Records Enrollment Files and Data Case Files Compensation Information and Data Computer Passwords Legal opinions of counsel Investigation Background Check Financial Information Business Information and Data Pending Projects and Proposals Research, Development, Marketing Strategies Tribal Council Minutes Pueblo Customs, Rites and Traditions In addition, certain files and documents kept by a federally funded program may be considered as part of the federal recordkeeping system and may be subject to the Privacy Act. All employees are required to sign a non-disclosure agreement as a condition of employment. Employees who improperly use or disclose trade secrets or confidential business information will be subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment and legal action, even if they do not benefit from the disclosed information. RECRUITMENT 201. Personnel Selection Committee a. ) For each vacancy the Tribal Administrator, in consultation with the Governor, shall appoint an Ad Hoc Personnel Selection Committee. The selection committee may be composed of two or more individuals including the Human Resources Director, the Department Director, and at least one Councilman knowledgeable in the field. The role of the Personnel Selection Committee shall be to review applications, evaluate applicants for employment based on job qualifications and experience, and recommend final selection of applicants to the Tribal Administrator and/or Governor. Immediate family members may not serve on the same personnel selection committee, nor may immediate family members of an interviewee serve on the Personnel Selection Committee evaluating that interviewee. b. ) The Committee must display fairness, honesty and integrity in the execution of its duties as Personnel Selection Committee members in screening and selecting employees for the Pueblo. If the Personnel Selection Committee or an individual member sees a conflict of interest arise, that person will remove themselves or be asked to remove themselves. c. ) The Tribal Council reserves the right to make the final decision or approve the final decision on the hiring of high level management positions. 202. Job Vacancies and Employee Transfers Job vacancies will first be posted on the employee bulletin board and within the community of the Pueblo. Announcements may be sent to other recruiting sources and publications as applicable. It is within the sole discretion of the Pueblo to fill a vacancy with an existing employee or hire a new employee from outside of the Pueblo. Each job posting notice will include the job title, department, location, job summary, essential duties, qualifications, and the closing date for receipt of applications. To be eligible to apply for a posted job, employees must have performed competently for at least ninety (90) calendar days in their current position. Employees who have not completed any corrective action issued in connection with a written warning, or who are on probation or suspension, are not eligible to apply for posted jobs. When an applicant is considered for a position, the hiring supervisor or Director will contact the applicant's Director to verify performance, skills, and attendance. Upon transfer to another program, an employee, at the discretion of the Pueblo, may be compensated for 50% of any accrued annual leave to be paid by the program from which the employee is transferring. The remaining accrued annual leave and all sick leaves shall be carried over to the new program. This policy is meant to prevent the new program from bearing the burden of carrying and covering the full amount of accrued annual leave for a transferred employee. 203. Employment Applications All applicants shall complete a Pueblo Employment Application Form. The Pueblo relies upon the accuracy of information contained in the employment application, as well as the accuracy of other data presented throughout the hiring process and employment. Any misrepresentations, falsifications, or material omissions in any of this data may result in the Pueblo's exclusion of the individual from further consideration for employment or, if the person has been hired, termination of employment. 204. Employment Reference Checks and Background Investigation It is the policy of the Pueblo to check the employment references of all applicants. Background investigations will be conducted on business managers for businesses operated by the Pueblo and not its corporation, financial managers, controller and assistant controller. These financial positions do not require an FBI Criminal History Records Search. It is the policy of the Pueblo that background investigations, and reinvestigations every five years, shall be conducted on those individuals in positions covered by Public Law 101-630, Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act for the protection of children and of the elderly. A favorable background investigation meeting the minimum standards of inquiries identified in federal regulations is a condition of employment for individuals working with, having regular contact with or having control over children and the elderly. Covered programs include but are not limited to the following: (1) All Health and Human Services programs including Community Health Representative Program, Diabetes Program;, Health Coalition, Senior Citizens Center, and the Indian Child Welfare Act Program; and (2) all Education programs including the Language Program, Recreation and Youth, the Parks and Wildlife Program and (3) the Tribal Courts. Each of the individuals must meet the minimum standards of character prescribed by federal laws and regulations to work in such programs or positions. The Background Investigations Program is designed to meet the minimum standards of investigative inquiries identified by federal laws and regulations. The Background investigation process requires investigation of individuals applying for or working in a paid or voluntary capacity, whether short term or long term, and includes: 1. FBI Criminal History Records Search via fingerprint checks. 2. State Repository Check - Criminal history checks within each state that the individual identifies as a former residence and each place of work for the last 5 years. 3. Local Law Enforcement Check - Law enforcement agency check (including tribal entities) within each state or jurisdiction that the individual identifies as a former residence and each place of work for the last 5 years. 4. Record/Reference Check from Former Employer - Record check for former employer(s) for the last 5 years. 5. Personal Reference Checks - At least three (3) reference contacts. 6. Record Check of Former School - Verification of last degree. The minimum standards of character prescribed by federal law and this Policy shall ensure that none of the individuals appointed to positions in the programs described above have been found guilty of, or entered a plea of nolo contendere or guilty to, (1) any felonious offense, or any of two or more misdemeanor offenses, under Federal or State law involving crimes of violence;, sexual assault, molestation, exploitation, contact or prostitution; (2) crimes against persons; or (3) offenses committed against children or elderly under Federal or State law. Any conviction in tribal court is not considered a felony. Suitability Determinations The Human Resources Director is the designated Suitability Official who determines suitability of prospective employees for employment and efficiency of service. The Pueblo may appoint one additional Suitability Official. The Suitability determination process protects the interests of the Pueblo and the rights of applicants and employees. The Suitability Determination Process requires uniform evaluation to ensure fair and consistent judgment. The Suitability Official is the designated representative for the Pueblo who directs proper background investigations and suitability determinations. The Suitability Official must be qualified for the position and the responsibilities of his/her office and must have a favorable background investigation and suitability determination. The Suitability Official receives and is responsible for the results of the fingerprint checks and all other background investigations. All precautions shall be taken to guarantee confidentiality. The Suitability Official should have a balanced, unbiased approach in the review of all investigations. Potential conflicts of interest shall be avoided. There are potential problems if the Suitability Official personally knows the subject of the investigation. Where a conflict of interest exists, the Tribal Administrator shall act as a temporary Suitability Official to conduct the background Investigation. A subordinate should not make a suitability determination for his/her immediate supervisor. The suitability determination process involves an assessment of past and present conduct that may indicate probable future actions with adverse impact on the efficiency of the interests of the Pueblo and which may violate Public Law 101-630, Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act. Criteria for Suitability Standards The assessment of suitability is made to establish a reasonable expectation that the employment or continued employment of a person either would or would not promote the interests and the efficiency of the Pueblo. This determination is based on considerations of whether the conduct of the person indicates a potential for behavior which would interfere with, prevent, or otherwise impact adversely on (1) the performance of the person in the position applied for or employed in; (2) the accomplishment of the duties and responsibilities of others in the Pueblo; or (3) the ability of the Pueblo to fully and effectively carry out its mandated responsibilities. Determination Factors for Suitability Standards In determining potential impact on the efficiency of the service, two issues are considered: (1) Whether the conduct in question indicates a potential for inadequate or reduced accomplishment of specific duties; and (2) whether the conduct indicates any immediate or long-term risk for abuse of trust in carrying out the responsibilities of the position. Conduct paralleling any of the following factors may be considered as a basis for disqualification: a. Delinquency or misconduct in prior employment; b. Criminal, dishonest, infamous or notoriously disgraceful conduct; c. Intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment; d. Habitual use of intoxicating beverages to excess; or e. Abuse of narcotics, drugs, or other controlled substances. The Suitability Official shall consider the following additional factors to the extent that these factors are deemed pertinent to the individual case: a. The kind of position for which the person is applying or in which the person is employed, including its trust risks; b. The nature and seriousness of the conduct; c. The circumstances surrounding the conduct; d. The recency of the conduct; e. The age of the applicant or employee at the time of the conduct; f. Contributing social or environmental conditions; and g. The absence or presence of rehabilitation or efforts toward rehabilitation. The Suitability Official shall determine suitability and complete a Certificate of Investigation form identifying the written investigation reports and verbal references received and favorable determination of suitability. The Suitability Official must obtain concurrence on a suitability decision from the Governor or Lt. Governor. The Certificate of Investigation is signed and dated by the Suitability Official and the Governor or Lt. Governor and placed in the employee's personnel file. The supporting documentation to the favorable determination can then be destroyed. The appropriate personnel will be notified that the employee has been cleared. In cases in which the Suitability Official with the concurrence of the Governor or Lt. Governor determines that the individual does not meet the character requirements and is unacceptable for employment, appropriate personnel will be notified and all documents supporting this unacceptable determination will be kept in a secure locked file. In cases in which a former employee of the Pueblo requires a reference regarding new employment, such reference request must be submitted in writing to the Human Resources Department. The response of the Human Resources Department shall be in writing and, except as otherwise required by law, will be limited to confirming only dates of employment, wage rates, and position(s) held. If a former employee would like the prospective employer to be provided with more information, that former employee must provide a written and signed authorization and release to their prior direct supervisor. 205. Hiring of Relatives Although the Pueblo has no prohibition against hiring relatives of existing employees, we are committed to monitoring situations in which relatives work in the same area. The employment of relatives in the same area of an organization may cause serious conflicts and problems with favoritism and employee morale. In addition to claims of partiality in treatment at work, personal conflicts from outside the work environment can be carried into day-to-day working relationships. In case of actual or potential problems between or among relatives who work in the same area, the Pueblo may monitor the problem and may take prompt action to attempt to resolve the problem. This may include reassignment or, if necessary because no resolution is possible, one or both employees may be required to resign or be terminated. A \"relative\" as used in this Policy is any person who is related by blood or marriage in the immediate family or whose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related by blood or marriage. The term includes employees who become related after employment. EMPLOYMENT STATUS &amp; RECORDS 301. Employment Categories Regular Full-Time: Employees who are not in a Temporary or Probationary status and who are regularly scheduled to work the Pueblo's full-time schedule which, in general, is thirty-two (32) or more hours per week. Generally, regular full-time employees are eligible for the Pueblo de San Ildefonso's benefits. Part-Time: Employees who are not assigned in a Temporary or Probationary status and who are regularly scheduled to work less than thirty-two (32) hours per week. Part-Time employees are generally ineligible for the Pueblo's benefits, unless otherwise expressly provided, in writing. Contract: A contract employee is an individual who provides services as stipulated in a contract/subcontract agreement and is not eligible for the rights and benefits of Pueblo. All employee contracts shall be reviewed and approved by the Governor and Tribal Administrator. All proper documentation shall be submitted to the Tribal Administrator including the contract and budget justification. Probationary: Employees whose performance is being evaluated to determine whether further employment in a specific position with the Pueblo is appropriate. Employees who satisfactorily complete the probationary period of ninety (90) calendar days will be notified of their new employment classification. The probationary period may be extended to continue assessment of the employee's performance. The probationary period will be extended by the same amount of days that have been authorized and taken as leave during the probationary period as described in Section 303. The employee shall be terminated if job performance during the probationary period is not satisfactory. Probationary employees accrue annual and sick leave from the date of hire, however, use of such leave by probationary employees during the probationary period is not authorized except in extraordinary circumstances as determined by the immediate supervisor and the Tribal Administrator. Temporary: Employees who are hired as interim replacements to temporarily supplement the work force, or to assist in the completion of a specific project or as an emergency hire. Employment assignments in this category are of a limited duration (90-Day or unless a waiver granted for the Governor for an extension). Employment beyond any initially stated period does not in any way imply a change in employment status. Temporary employees retain that status unless and until notified of a change. Temporary employees are ineligible for the Pueblo's benefits, unless otherwise expressly provided. Exempt Employees : Employees in positions classified in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA is the acronym for Federal Labor Standards Act of 1938 as amended), are exempt and shall not be eligible for overtime pay because of supervisory, managerial, professional, or otherwise exercise independent judgment and discretion in the performance of their job duties. Exempt employees will be compensated on the basis of an annual salary. Overtime and Compensatory Time refer to Section 411. Non-Exempt Employees: Employees in positions classified in accordance with the FLSA which are eligible for overtime pay at a rate of one and one-half times (1 1/2 ) their regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours per week. Nonexempt employees will be compensated on an hourly basis. For Overtime and Compensatory Time refer to Section 411. 302. Job Descriptions Job descriptions shall be developed for each employee of the Pueblo. The employee shall be required to read their job description and shall acknowledge complete agreement with the stated responsibilities by signing the description. The job description shall be a part of the employee's personnel file. 303 . Probationary Period The probationary period is intended to give new employees the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to achieve a satisfactory level of performance and to determine whether the new position meets their expectations. The Pueblo de San Ildefonso uses this period to evaluate employees' capabilities, work habits, and overall performance. All new, transferred and rehired employees work on a probationary basis for the first ninety (90) calendar days after their date of hire or transfer. A probationary employee may be terminated or transferred at will during the probationary period when his or her abilities or performance are judged insufficient by the immediate supervisor. Transferred employees may be reinstated to their former positions, or an equivalent position they are qualified for, provided such a position is available. New employees are not eligible to receive benefits within the probationary period. New employees will accrue annual and sick leave from the date of hire but are generally not eligible to use or be paid for such leave during the probationary period except in extraordinary circumstances as determined by the immediate supervisor and Tribal Administrator. Upon satisfactory completion of the probationary period, the probationary employee shall become either a Regular Full-Time or Regular Part-Time employee. However, successful completion of the probationary period does not modify or change the employee's \"at-will\" status and does not entitle an employee to an automatic increase in pay for the change to a \"regular employee\" status. 304. Performance Evaluation A formal written performance evaluation will be conducted at the end of an employee's initial period of hire, known as the probationary period. Additional formal performance evaluations are conducted to provide both Directors and employees the opportunity to discuss job tasks, identify and correct weaknesses, encourage and recognize strengths, and discuss positive, purposeful approaches for meeting goals. This clause applies to new hires, rehires and transferred employees. The Tribal Administrator and Governor will evaluate the Directors. The Governor and Tribal Council will evaluate the Tribal Administrator. Directors and supervisors will conduct performance evaluations of all their employees on a 12-month cycle, beginning at the employee's date of hire. At the discretion of the Director or Tribal Administrator, evaluations may be conducted on a more frequent basis. 305. Personal Data Changes It is the responsibility of each employee to promptly notify the Pueblo of any changes in personal data. Names, personal mailing addresses, telephone numbers, number and names of dependents, individuals to be contacted in the event of emergency, educational accomplishments, and other such status reports should be accurate and current at all times. If any personal data has changed, notify the Human Resources Department. 306. Access to Personnel Files The Pueblo maintains a personnel file on each employee. The personnel file includes the employee's job application, resume, job description, records of training, documentation of performance appraisals and salary increases, disciplinary action and other employment records. Personnel files are the property of the Pueblo, and access to the information they contain is restricted to the employee, the employee's Director and/or Supervisor, and Administrative Management personnel of the Pueblo with a legitimate reason to review information in an employee's file. Employees may review their own personnel files, with advance notice, in the presence of the Human Resources Director. Employees will be notified of any request by an outside agency to view their personnel file. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Eligible employees are provided benefits by the Pueblo for the welfare of employees and these benefits are not to be abused. Employees with questions about any of the benefits provided by the Pueblo should ask their Director or the Human Resources Director. In case of a conflict between any benefit described in this Policy or in a specific plan, summary plan description, or other legal document, the language of the specific plan, shall prevail, unless otherwise expressly stated in writing. 401. Annual Leave Annual leave with pay is available to eligible employees to provide opportunities for rest, relaxation, and personal pursuits. Annual Leave is scheduled leave that is provided to Regular Full-Time Employees upon successful completion of the probationary period. Employees who have worked for the Pueblo for less than three (3) years shall receive fourteen days Annual Leave per year. Employees who have worked for the Pueblo for between three (3) to seven (7) years shall receive sixteen (16) days annual leave per year. Employees who have worked for the Pueblo for more than seven (7) years shall receive eighteen (18) days annual leave per year. Employees may take their Annual Leave at any time during the year with prior approval from their Director. Accrual of Annual Leave shall end on December 31, 2008 and shall not be carried over from year to year beginning January 1, 2009. Annual leave accrued through 2008 will be paid out if not used by February 28, 2009. For the year 2009, Annual Leave will be budgeted for Employees in the full annual amount stated above starting on March 1, 2009. Starting in 2010, Annual Leave will be budgeted in the full annual amounted stated above to eligible employees on January 1, 2010 and on January 1 st of each year thereafter. Employees hired after January 1 in any year will have Annual Leave budgeted in an amount pro-rated to the nearest month of employment remaining for that year and whole day of leave, as determined by the Tribal Administrator. For Annual Leave which requires more than five (5) consecutive days of leave, the employee should submit an Annual Leave request no later than one week prior to the scheduled dates and obtain prior approval from their Director. A request for annual leave will be granted at the discretion of the supervisor and/or Director. Any Annual Leave unused at the end of employment will not be paid. 402. Sick Leave Sick Leave can be scheduled or unscheduled leave that is provided to Regular Full-Time employees. Sick Leave is provided to employees after successful completion of the probationary period. As of March 1, 2009 for 2009, and on January 1 of each year starting with 2010, each employee is entitled to twelve (12) days of sick leave each year. Sick Leave may be authorized when an employee is incapacitated by sickness or injury; for medical, dental, or optical diagnosis or treatment; when the Employee's attendance jeopardizes the health of others; or for the care of immediate family members in the event of serious illness.

Requests for sick leave can be made in advance if known (scheduled), but must be submitted within one day after returning to work after sick leave has been used (unscheduled). A physician's verification may be required at any time a director feels that sick leave is being abused. Upon separation of employment with the Pueblo, any unused Sick Leave will not be paid. 403. Bereavement Leave Employees who must take time off due to the death of an immediate family member must notify their Director immediately. A Regular Full-Time employee will be paid for up to four (4) days of Bereavement Leave per year. Annual or Sick Leave may be used for time off work for bereavement in all other instances. Administrative leave may be granted at the sole discretion of the Governor. 404. Family and Medical Leave Of Absence In accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the Pueblo provides family leave of absence, without pay, to eligible employees for birth or adoption or foster placement of a child, serious health conditions of a child, the serious health condition of a parent or spouse, or the employee's own serious health condition. General Guidelines Employees may be eligible to take an unpaid family or medical leave of up to a total of 12 workweeks in any 12-month period for the following reasons, as defined by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993: The birth of a child of an employee or the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care. Entitlement to leave for the birth or placement of a child for adoption or foster care expires 12 months from the date of birth or placement of the child. To care for a spouse, child or parent who has a serious health condition. Because of a serious health condition of the employee. In cases where both spouses are employed by the Pueblo, the combined period of their family and medical leave will be limited to 12 workweeks in any 12-month period, for birth or adoption of a child. In all other instances, including covered health conditions of the employee or the employee's spouse, parent or child, each spouse is entitled to his or her own full 12 weeks of family leave. The amount of leave that an employee is entitled to at any given time will be determined on a rolling 12-month period, measured backward from the date an employee uses any leave, as defined under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. All employees are required to designate brief absences as FMLA leave within two (2) days following their return from leave if the Pueblo has not previously designated this absence as FMLA leave. If an employee fails to designate the leave at that time, they may not be able to qualify that absence as FMLA leave at a later date. Employee Eligibility To be eligible for unpaid family and medical leave, an employee must be qualified under the terms of the Family and Medical Leave Act, meaning, the employee must: Have worked for the Pueblo at least 12 months. Have at least 1250 hours of service during the 12-month period prior to the leave. Benefits While On Leave During an approved family and medical leave, an employee is entitled to receive health benefits at the same level and terms of coverage as if they had been working throughout the leave. An employee is not entitled to the accrual of any seniority or leave benefits that would have accrued if not for the taking of leave. Annual leave and sick leave will be suspended during the leave period and will resume upon return to active employment. An employee who takes family or medical leave will not lose any seniority or leave benefits that accrued before the date leave began. Restoration Of Employment After Leave The Pueblo will reinstate an employee returning from family and medical leave to the same or to an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment. However, an employee on leave does not have a greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if the employee had been continuously employed during the leave period. An employee may be requested to submit a physician's release to return to work if leave was for his or her own health condition. Status Reports While On Leave Employees on family leave may be required, on a periodic basis, to report their status and intent to return, to designated Pueblo representatives. Substitution of Accrued/Earned Time Off The Pueblo requires employees to first substitute all accrued/earned Annual Leave and Sick Leave as part or all of the 12 work week period. After all paid leave has been exhausted; any time remaining in the 12 work week period must be taken without pay. Care for a Child After Childbirth or Adoption or Foster Care Placement Scheduling/Notice: Family leaves taken for childbirth or adoption or foster care placement must be taken within 12 months of the birth or the adoption or foster care placement. Employees must notify Pueblo thirty (30) days in advance or give as much advance notice as is practical depending upon conditions. Care for Spouse, Child_ or Parent or Employee's Own Serious Health Condition Scheduling/Notice: An employee requesting family leave due to their own serious health condition or for the serious health condition of their spouse, child, or parent, must notify both their Director and the Tribal Administrator thirty (30) days in advance or give as much advance notice as is practical depending on conditions. Certification: The Pueblo requires a written explanation from the covered family member's physician or the employee's physician of the need for family leave, in both the case of an employee's own serious health condition and that of a covered family member. The Pueblo of San Ildefonso will require written approval from the employee's treating physician of fitness to return to work for an employee's own serious health condition. The Pueblo reserves the right to review all information about medical certifications in accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. Full Time versus Intermittent Leave Employees may request intermittent or reduced leave schedules. If the necessity for the leave is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, employees must make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as not to disrupt the operations of the Pueblo. In addition, the employee shall provide as much notice of the request to take such leave as practicably possible. The Pueblo requires employees to provide a written explanation from the employee's physician of the dates and duration of the expected treatment, as well as the medical necessity for intermittent or reduced leave schedule. Temporary Transfers An employee who requests such an intermittent or reduced leave schedule may be temporarily transferred to an alternative position, if such a position is available, having equivalent pay and benefits that the employee is qualified for and that better accommodates recurring periods of leave, as determined by Pueblo. 405. Other Unpaid Personal Leave Of Absence Unpaid personal leaves of absence may be granted for reasons other than those specified in this Policy. Any employee who wants a personal leave of absence must place such request in writing, including the reason and duration of such leave, and submit that request to the Director/Tribal Administrator. The Tribal Administrator and the Governor, within their sole discretion, will make a determination on the request jointly. In making that decision, the needs and concern of the employee are balanced with the demands of the Pueblo. In some cases, the Pueblo may grant a leave for a lesser period of time than that requested by the employee. All accrued/earned leave must be exhausted before a personal leave of absence will be granted. At the time such leave is granted, the Pueblo will inform the employee whether they are to be reinstated to their regular position. If during such a leave of absence, it is necessary to fill the position of the employee on leave, that employee will be so informed and will have the option of immediately returning to work in the position held prior to the leave, or in a different capacity as determined by the Pueblo. Benefit accruals such as annual leave and sick leave will be suspended during the leave period and will resume upon return to active employment. 406. Holidays The Pueblo will grant paid time off to all employees on the holidays listed below: New Year's Day (January 1) King's Day (January 6) Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday Pueblo de San Ildefonso Feast Eve (January 22) Pueblo de San Ildefonso Feast Day (January 23) President's Day (February) Good Friday (Friday before Easter) Memorial Day (last Monday in May) Independence Day (4 a ' of July) Pop\u00e9 Day (August 10) Labor Day (first Monday in September) Veteran's Day (November 11) Thanksgiving Day (fourth Thursday in November) Day after Thanksgiving Christmas Eve (December 24) Christmas Day (December 25) New Year's Eve (December 31) If a recognized holiday falls during an eligible employee's paid absence (such as when the employee is on Annual Leave or Sick Leave), holiday pay will be provided instead of the paid time off benefit that would otherwise have applied. If holiday falls on an employee's mandatory workday, employee will take the holiday the next working day. A holiday which falls on a Saturday will be observed on the preceding Friday. A holiday which falls on a Sunday will be observed on the following Monday. 407. Military Leave Annual Military Reserve Leave Employees who have a military, service obligation requiring participation of up to two weeks of reserve camp annually will be granted a leave of absence from the Pueblo. Such an employee may elect to charge such absence against his or her accrued Annual Leave or other paid time off provided that advance notice is given to the employee's Director and to the Tribal Administrator. If the employee does not choose to use such Annual Leave or other paid time off, the Pueblo will pay the employee the amount of his or her salary, from which shall be deducted all amounts received from the military service (i.e. base pay plus bonus for flying time, demolition service, etc., but not including allowances for travel, clothing, rent, subsistence, etc.). Service in the Uniformed Services Employees who serve in the uniformed services shall be provided leave and benefits in accordance with Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act (\"VEVRA\"). 408. Time Off To Vote The Pueblo encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities by participating in elections. Generally, employees are expected to find time to vote either before or after their regular work schedule. If employees are unable to vote in an election during their non-working hours, the Pueblo will grant up to two (2) hours of paid time off to vote. 409. Jury Duty Any time served by an employee in connection with jury duty will be considered time worked and the Pueblo will pay the employee his or her regular salary during the time of such service. Any amount received by the employee for jury duty, exclusive of mileage, will be turned over to the Accounting Department. As an alternative, the employee may request Annual Leave for these days and keep jury duty pay. Proof of service will be required. 410. Overtime and Compensatory Time Non-exempt employees may be required to work overtime. Such overtime will be assigned as needed and at the discretion of their Director. To the extent possible, the Director will give notice of overtime work. Exempt employees are not eligible for overtime compensation.

A non-exempt employee will be paid at a rate of one and one-half times their regular hourly rate of pay for all actual time worked in excess of forty (40) hours in any one workweek with their Director's approval. At the Director's discretion, an employee may earn compensatory time at the rate of 1 \u00bd hours per hour worked in lieu of overtime pay. Compensatory time must be used within 10 working days of the date compensatory time occurred. 411. Administrative Leave of Absence In appropriate circumstances, as determined within the sole discretion of the Governor, paid Administrative Leave of absence may be granted to employees. Examples of administrative leave granted to all employees include instances of inclement weather, or traditional activities. Other situations not specifically identified in this section may also qualify for administrative leave. Individual employees may also request administrative leave for traditional, religious or cultural activities. Upon receipt of a written request for administrative leave for traditional, religious or cultural activities, the Governor, in his sole discretion, may grant paid administrative leave for a total of up to ten (10) days annually. Additional time may be granted at the Governor's discretion. Administrative leave for traditional, religious or cultural activities cannot be accumulated and carried over from year to year. 412. Donation of Sick Leave Employees may donate sick leave to other tribal employees funding program when unique circumstances exist. Any employee wishing to ask for donations of leave from other employees must place such a request in writing to the Governor for approval, including the reason for the donation request. Donated leave shall be considered as Sick Leave for the recipient employee and shall only be used for medical or health reasons and is subject to the same restrictions as all other sick leave. All other forms of leave must be exhausted or nearly exhausted before a request for donation of sick leave will be granted. Donated sick leave will first be donated within the department then within funds (General, Federal and Enterprise Funds), sick leave will then be calculated at the donors hours and rate converted to the users rate to calculate the hours. ATTENDANCE In order to fulfill its obligations to the community and to be fair to one another, the Pueblo must rely on a staff of dependable employees. Employees are expected to work as scheduled and to minimize unscheduled absences and lateness. While it is recognized that absences will occur for any number of valid reasons, it is the expectation of the Pueblo that employees be responsible about their jobs and that they maintain an excellent attendance record. 501. Definitions \"Absence\" - Any unapproved absence time lost from work regardless of reason, including Sick Leave. Excluding annual leave, holidays, medical leave, jury duty and other absences, which have been approved in advance. Absences are measured daily from the first occurrence and continuously thereafter. Days or parts of days of absence, whether successive or scattered in occurrence, are counted separately, e.g., three (3) successive days of absence are equal to three absences. \"Lateness\" - The late arrival or early departure from the workstation at any time during an employee's regularly assigned schedule. Lateness is measured from the first occurrence and continuously thereafter. EXCEPTION: If lateness is due to problems with transportation, weather emergencies and the like, and at the discretion of the employee's supervisor, the employee may make up the lost time during the day. In such cases, the lateness will be deleted from the employee's record. \"Excessive Lost Time\" - An emerging pattern of absenteeism and/or lateness. An employee may be terminated for excessive episodes of absence or lateness. \"Scheduled Time Off\" - Leave or time off that is approved in advance, including: 1. Annual Leave 2. Jury Duty 3. Bereavement Leave 4. Medical Leave/FMLA 5. Military, Reserve and National Guard Training Leave 6. Administrative Leave 502. Timekeeping and Documenting Accurately recording time worked is the responsibility of every employee. Federal laws require the Pueblo to keep an accurate record of time worked in order to calculate employee pay and benefits. Time worked is the time actually spent on the job performing assigned duties. Altering, falsifying, tampering with timesheets, or recording time on another employee's timesheet may result in disciplinary action including termination of employment. It is the employees' responsibility to sign their timesheets to certify the accuracy of all time recorded. The Director will review and sign the timesheet before submitting it for payroll processing. 503. Work Schedules The normal work schedule for all Regular Full-Time employees is eight (8) hours a day, five (5) days a week. Monday through Friday, 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. with a one (1) hour lunch break. Staffing needs and operational demands may necessitate variations in starting and ending times, as well as variations in the total hours that may be scheduled each day and week. Scheduling is at the discretion of the Governor and may be changed at any time to suit the requirements of the Pueblo. Employees shall have the privilege of two breaks per day with a one-hour lunch break, except where the press of business makes such breaks inappropriate. One fifteen (15) minute break shall be taken in the morning and one fifteen (15) minute break in the afternoon. Flexible scheduling, or flextime, is available in some cases to allow employees to vary their starting and ending times each day within established limits. Flextime may be possible if a mutually workable schedule can be negotiated with the Director involved. However, such issues as staffing needs, the employee's performance, and the nature of the job will be considered before approval of flextime. 504. Separation from Employment The Pueblo will implement the separation of employees from employment as appropriate and necessary. All those concerned will treat any separation from employment in a professional and confidential manner. Separation from employment is normally implemented by one of the following actions and shall be done in accordance with the stated policies and procedures: Voluntary Separation Resignation: This is a voluntary separation of employment initiated by the employee. An employee wishing to terminate employment in good standing is expected to give as much advance notice as possible. Two (2) weeks or ten (10) working days is generally considered sufficient notice time. A voluntary resignation should be done in writing by the employee and confirmed in writing by the supervisor/director. A confirmed resignation may be withdrawn by written request of the employee and at the sole discretion and written approval of the Governor. An employee absent from work without authorization or without notifying their supervisor for three (3) consecutive days, may be deemed to have effected a voluntary \"no call/no show\" resignation. An employee, who voluntarily resigns from employment, shall be entitled to receive all earned wages subject to deductions for any indebtedness or unreturned property. Payment for earned hours shall be processed as quickly as possible within two weeks after the date of resignation but is subject to the following time constraints: verification of time worked, return of equipment, calculation of any costs owed to the Pueblo by the employee, and other indebtedness. Involuntary Separation Discharge: This is defined as an involuntary termination of employment from the Pueblo for substandard performance, or misconduct, or at any time during the probationary period. Employees may be terminated in accordance with their at-will employment status. An employee may be discharged when in the judgment of the administration the seriousness of the matter is such that the employee cannot be permitted to remain on the workforce. a. Substandard Performance: An employee may be discharged from employment if their performance is unacceptable. It is important for Directors and supervisors to identify potential performance deficiencies or problems as early as possible and take prompt measures in an attempt to correct the situation in consultation with the Tribal Administrator to avoid termination. However, this process may not apply for a discharge of an employee during the probationary period. Before discharging any employee, a supervisor must consult with the Tribal Administrator and Governor who must concur in advance of notifying the employee of discharge action. b. Misconduct: The Pueblo reserves the right to either 1) suspend or terminate an employee immediately upon the occurrence of misconduct or 2) subject the employee to its progressive discipline policy to be engaged in activities such as, but not limited to, theft of the Pueblo tribal property or the property of another employee, insubordination, assault, harassment (see Section 606) or any other activities showing willful disregard of the Pueblo interests or policies. It is important for Directors and supervisors to identify potential performance deficiencies or problems as early as possible and take prompt measures in an attempt to correct the situation in consultation with the Tribal Administrator. If a possibility of continuing misconduct requires that action be taken before consultation with the Tribal Administrator and Governor can take place or if the misconduct is so serious, a Director may suspend the employee temporarily. Pending the results of further review and investigation by the Tribal Administrator and Governor, the suspension may be with or without pay. Refer to Section 704 (3) c. Discharge during the Probationary Period: The probationary period is a period of service during which Pueblo assesses the performance of an employee to determine whether the employee satisfactorily meets the requirements of the position. The termination of a probationary employee during the probationary period may be without cause but requires the approval of the appropriate Director, Tribal Administrator or the Governor. A probationary employee who is discharged during the probationary period shall only be entitled to pay for any hours worked. An employee who is involuntarily separated from employment shall be entitled to receive all earned pay subject to deductions for any indebtedness or unreturned property. Payment for earned hours shall be processed as quickly as possible after the date of termination but is subject to the following time constraints: verification of time worked, return of equipment, calculation of any costs owed to the Pueblo by the employee, other indebtedness, completion of specific projects, etc. 505. Return of Property Employees are responsible for items issued to them by the Pueblo or in their possession or control, including but not limited to the following: 1. Credit cards 2. Equipment 3. Identification badges 4. Keys 5. Manuals 6. Cellular Telephones 7. Pagers 8. Tools 9. Uniforms 10. Vehicles 11. PC/Lap Top Computer Employees must return all Pueblo property on or before their last day of work to their supervisor or the Human Resources Department. The Pueblo may withhold from the employee's check or final paycheck the cost of any items that are not returned when required. The Pueblo may also take all action deemed appropriate to recover or protect its property. SPECIAL WORK PLACE POLICIES 601. Use of Phone and Mail Systems Employees may be required to reimburse the Pueblo for any charges resulting from their personal use of any Pueblo-owned telephones, including cellular phones. The use of the Pueblo paid postage for personal correspondence is not permitted. 602. No Smoking Policy In keeping with the Pueblo intent to provide a safe and healthy work environment, smoking in the workplace is prohibited and permitted only in designated areas. This policy applies equally to all employees, community members, and visitors. 603. Use of Equipment and Vehicles Equipment and vehicles essential in accomplishing job duties are expensive and may be difficult to replace. When using Pueblo property, employees are expected to exercise care, perform required maintenance, and follow all operating instructions, safety standards, and guidelines. Only authorized personnel may use equipment and vehicles. Employees' must be insurable and may require certification or training. The Director should be notified if any equipment, machines, tools, or vehicles appear to be damaged, defective, or in need of repair. Prompt reporting of damages, defects, and the need for repairs could prevent deterioration of equipment and possible injury to employees or others. The improper, careless, negligent, destructive, or unsafe use or operation of equipment or vehicles, as well as excessive or avoidable traffic and parking violations, can result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Employees are required to notify their supervisor if their driver's license becomes invalid for any reason if the operation of a motor vehicle is an integral or required part of the employee's job duties. For specific information and detailed guidelines, please refer to the Tribal Vehicle Use Policy. 604. Visitors in the Workplace To provide for the safety and security of employees and the facilities at the Pueblo, only authorized visitors are allowed in the workplace. Restricting unauthorized visitors helps maintain safety standards, protects against theft, ensures security of equipment, protects confidential information, safeguards employee welfare, and avoids potential distractions and disturbances. Employees are responsible for the conduct and safety of their visitors. If an unauthorized individual is observed on the Pueblo's premises, employees should immediately notify the Administrative Receptionist or, if necessary, direct the individual to the reception area. 605. Use of Information Systems and Networks The Pueblo's information systems (IS) - networks, software, and computers - are valuable company assets, provided to employees as tools to function competitively in our business. Limited non-business use of them is permissible when it does not interfere with business use of the systems and is consistent with job responsibilities, other Pueblo policies, ethical considerations and all applicable laws. Employees must understand that such non-business use creates no privacy right for any data stored on Pueblo information systems or any data sent over Pueblo networks. The Pueblo reserves the right to access, review, and exclude material transmitted over or stored in these systems and networks and may terminate any activity related to its systems and networks which is believed to be inappropriate or in violation of policies. Failure to adhere to these requirements may result in the employee's restriction or prohibition from use of Pueblo information systems and networks. Any employee determined by the Pueblo to have misused the technology, and supervisors who have failed to control the use of these resources appropriately, may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination. As used in this Policy, \"systems\" includes the use of all Pueblo owned or controlled resources to access both internal and external networks and systems. Systems may be any combination of computers, software, accessories, utilities and storage devices and media. Networks refer to any system for the transport of data, video, or voice. Following are examples of inappropriate uses of Pueblo information systems and networks: 1. Any use violating law or government regulation; 2. Forwarding or permitting unauthorized access to proprietary or confidential Pueblo information; 3. Use promoting disrespect for an individual, discrimination, or constituting a personal attack, including ethnic jokes or slurs; 4. Viewing, copying, or transmitting material with sexual content, harassing or soliciting messages or chain letters, including \"charitable\" chain letters; 5. Defamatory, inflammatory or derogatory statements about individuals, companies or their products; 6. Disclosing private facts about an individual; 7. Posting third-party proprietary information in a non-restricted environment; 8. Using copyrighted material without legal right; 9. Permitting or obtaining unauthorized access to any systems or networks; 10. Use for personal financial gain or in a manner creating a potential conflict of interest for Pueblo of San Ildefonso; 11. Forwarding communications of a third party without permission or without the original header. Employees are accountable for use of Pueblo information systems and networks in accordance with these policies, and should request clarification from Directors or systems managers to ensure their understanding of any possible improper use, and should report all potential misuse to their Directors. Directors are responsible for the correct use of Pueblo assets, and must take steps to ensure that systems they manage are operated in support of Pueblo business. Directors are expected to communicate policies in a manner that ensures employees understand proper and improper use, should hold employees accountable, and should periodically monitor resources under their control for use in accordance with this policy. 606. Workplace Safety Directors are responsible for maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for their staff. Given the increasing violence in society in general, the Pueblo has adopted the following guidelines to deal with intimidation, harassment, threats of, or actual, violence that may occur during business hours or on its premises. Zero-Tolerance The Pueblo maintains a zero-tolerance policy regarding all workplace violence. Violence will result in immediate discharge. Definition of Workplace Safety The word \"violence\" in this policy shall mean an act or behavior that: 1. is an actual physical assault; 2. A reasonable person would perceive as obsessively directed, e.g., intensely focused on a grudge, grievance, or romantic interest in another person, and reasonably likely to result in harm or threats of harm to persons or property; 3. Consists of a communicated or reasonably perceived threat to harm another individual or in any way endanger the safety of an individual; 4. Would be interpreted by a reasonable person as carrying potential for physical harm to the individual; 5. Is a behavior, or action, that a reasonable person would perceive as menacing; 6. Involves carrying or displaying weapons, destroying property, or throwing objects in a manner reasonably perceived to be threatening; or 7. Consists of a communicated or reasonably perceived threat to destroy property. Violent actions on Pueblo property or facilities, or while on Pueblo business, will not be tolerated or ignored; the Pueblo intends to use reasonable legal, managerial, administrative, and disciplinary procedures to secure the workplace from violence and to reasonably protect employees and members of the public. All employees, and everyone on Pueblo property, should be treated with courtesy and respect at all times. Employees are expected to refrain from fighting, \"horseplay,\" or other conduct that may be dangerous to others. Firearms, weapons, and other dangerous or hazardous devices or substances are prohibited from the premises of the Pueblo without proper authorization. Conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another employee, a client, or a member of the public at any time, including off-duty periods, will not be tolerated. This prohibition includes all acts of harassment, including harassment that is based on an individual's sex, race, age, or any characteristic protected by federal law. All threats of, or actual, violence, both direct and indirect, must be reported as soon as possible to your immediate Director or any other member of management. This includes threats by employees, as well as threats by community members, vendors, solicitors, or other members of the public. When reporting a threat of violence, you should be as specific and detailed as possible. The Pueblo will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats and/or actual violence and suspicious individuals or activities. The identity of the individual making a report will be protected as much as is practical. In order to maintain workplace safety and the integrity of its investigation, the Pueblo may suspend employees, either with or without pay, pending investigation. Anyone determined to be responsible for threats of, or actual violence or other conduct that is in violation of these guidelines will be subject to prompt disciplinary action, including termination of employment. The Pueblo encourages employees to bring their disputes or differences with other employees to the attention of their Directors or the Human Resources Department. If the matter cannot be resolved, then the Director and employee together should bring the matter to the attention of the Tribal Administrator. Thereafter, within the discretion of the Tribal Administrator, the matter may be brought to the attention of the Governor. The Pueblo is eager to assist in the resolution of employee disputes, and will not discipline employees for raising such concerns. EMPLOYEE CONDUCT &amp; DISCIPLINARY ACTION 701. Employee Conduct and Work Rules To ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, the Pueblo of San Ildefonso expects employees to follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all employees and the organization. It is not possible to list all the forms of behavior that are considered unacceptable in the workplace. The following is a representative list of infractions of rules of conduct that may result in disciplinary action, including immediate termination of employment: 1. Theft or inappropriate removal or possession of property. 2. Falsification of timekeeping records or any other administrative form. 3. No employee shall have the right to speak for, or on behalf of the Pueblo without the express prior approval of the Governor. If and when an employee is properly delegated to speak for, or on behalf of the Pueblo, they are required to be accurate and exercise restraint. 4. Working under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs. 5. Possession, distribution, sale, transfer, or use of alcohol or illegal drugs in the workplace, while on duty, or while operating employer-owned vehicles or equipment. 6. Fighting or threatening violence in the workplace. 7. Boisterous or disruptive activity in the workplace. 8. Negligence or improper conduct leading to damage of property. 9.

The Pueblo's position in its community and its service to and reputation with the public cannot be compromised by the adverse effect of drug and alcohol abuse on the performance and judgment of its personnel. The Pueblo also recognizes the significant human and business costs arising from the damaging effects of drug and alcohol use. COMPREHENSIVE SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM (five steps) Dealing with Substance Abuse San IIdefonso Pueblo is a business. We are in the business of providing educational, employment and social services to Native Americans. The Pueblo must send a clear signal to present and future employees that we are committed to maintaining a drug and alcohol free workplace. The Pueblo's comprehensive Workplace Substance Abuse Program entails a five step process which includes the following components: 1. A written substance abuse policy 2. An employee education and awareness program 3. A supervisory training program 4. Access to an employee assistance program (EAP) 5. A drug testing program POLICY ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE (step 1) Statement of Need The Pueblo has a strong commitment to the health, safety, and welfare of its employees, their families, and its constituents. Widely available statistics and information establish that the incidence of drug and alcohol abuse is increasing and that the effect is devastating to lives, business, and the community at large. The Pueblo is concerned that due to the potential for abuse among some of our employees, the safety of our employees and the general public could be endangered. Our commitment to maintaining a safe and secure workplace requires a clear policy and supportive programs relating to the detection, treatment, and prevention of substance abuse by employees. Goal 1. It is the goal of the Pueblo to comply with federal regulations and guidelines established to reduce the use and abuse of controlled substances and drugs in the workplace. 2. To provide a safe workplace by eliminating the hazards to health and job safety created by alcohol and other drug abuse. Scope This policy applies to all applicants seeking employment and employees of the Pueblo while on the job and to situations when an employee's off-the-job or off-premises conduct impairs work performance, or harms the reputation of the Pueblo. It is also intended to apply to employees of firms doing business with the Pueblo while on our premises or on tribal lands. Although the Pueblo has no intention of intruding into the private lives of its employees, we recognize that involvement with alcohol or other drugs off the job eventually takes its toll on job performance. Our concern is to assure those employees report to work in condition to perform their duties safely and efficiently in the interest of their fellow workers and constituents as well as themselves. Pueblo Policy Statements on Substance Abuse 1. The Pueblo will not tolerate or condone substance abuse. It is the policy of the Pueblo to maintain a workplace free from alcohol and other drug abuse and its effects. The Pueblo therefore will enforce a comprehensive substance abuse program committing to the safety and well being of its entire employee. 2. It is the policy of the Pueblo that employees who engage in the sale, use, possession, or transfer of illegal drugs or controlled substances, or buy or sell such substances, or use alcohol during work hours, or abuse prescribed drugs, will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. (However, nothing in this policy precludes the appropriate use of legally prescribed medications). 3. It is the policy of the Pueblo to commit the resources necessary to achieve and maintain a drug-and alcohol-free environment. It may conduct alcohol and other drug screening tests both prospective to and during employment. 4. The Pueblo expects the full support of this policy by all employees and all persons doing business with the Pueblo. It will cooperate with Tribal and outside law enforcement agencies. 5. As a condition of employment, employees must abide by the terms of this policy and must notify the Pueblo in writing of any indictment or conviction of a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace no later than five calendar days after such conviction. Policy Prohibitions The Pueblo's policy prohibits the following: 1. Use, possession, manufacture, distribution, dispensation, or sale of illegal drugs on Pueblo premises during working hours or non-working hours. 2. Controlled substance abuse on Pueblo premises during working hours or nonworking hours. 3. Storing any illegal drug or alcohol in a locker, desk, or other repository on Pueblo premises. 4. Being under the influence of an illegal drug or engaging in controlled substance abuse on Pueblo premises, or while engaged in Pueblo business, or in Pueblo-supplied vehicles, during working hours or non-working hours. 5. Testing positive for illegal drugs or controlled substances without a legal basis for use. 6. Switching or adulterating any urine sample submitted for testing, or submitting a false sample for testing. 7. Use, possession, sale, or distribution of alcohol, or being under the influence of alcohol on Pueblo premises, or in-Pueblo-supplied vehicles, whether during working hours or non-working hours. 8. Refusing consent to testing or refusing to submit a urine sample for testing when required by the Pueblo. 9. Failing, when requested by the Pueblo, to enroll in any alcohol or other drug treatment or counseling program and failing to adhere to the requirements of the program. 10. Being indicted or convicted under any criminal drug statute for a violation occurring in the workplace or outside the workplace. 11. Failing to notify the Pueblo of any indictment or conviction under any criminal drug statute within 5 days of the event. 12. Failing to comply with rules and regulations promulgated under any testing programs maintained by the Pueblo pursuant to such rules and regulations. Employee Responsibility The Pueblo believes that each employee has a responsibility to: 1. Report to work at all times free of alcohol or other drugs and their effects. 2. Participate in and support Pueblo-sponsored drug and alcohol education programs. 3. Seek and accept assistance for alcohol and other drug abuse related problems before job performance is affected. 4. Support the Pueblo efforts to eliminate alcohol and other drug abuse among employees where it exists. Implementation Each Program within the Pueblo will be responsible for implementing these policies and procedures. If an individual program requires a more specific plan tailored to meet its needs, it must be consistent and support this policy. Each of these specific plans is subject to review for consistency and compliance with the Pueblo's policy on substance abuse and must first be approved by the Pueblo. EMPLOYEE EDUCATION AND AWARENESS PROGRAM (step 2) Self-Referral Employees with personal drug or controlled substance abuse problems should request assistance through their individual Programs, the Human Resources Department or the Pueblo's employee assistance program. Assistance will be provided on a confidential basis, and each employee will be referred to the appropriate treatment and counseling services. Employees who voluntarily request assistance in dealing with drug or controlled substance abuse problems may do so without jeopardizing their continued employment with the Pueblo subject to the Special Consideration below. Pueblo Referral Employees who test positive for illegal drug use or controlled substance abuse and who are referred, at the Pueblo's request, for counseling or treatment will be limited to one opportunity for counseling or treatment to cease the use of illegal drugs and alcohol. A second positive test following treatment for the use of illegal drugs will result in immediate termination. Employees terminated for this reason will be ineligible for rehire. Special Consideration All Pueblo-referred, employee counseling and/or treatment, will require that the employee immediately cease any illegal drug and/or controlled substance abuse and the employee be subject to periodic unannounced testing for a 12 month period following enrollment in the program. Undergoing treatment or counseling for the first time will normally not jeopardize an employee's employment. However, the Pueblo is required in certain situations to report an employee's involvement with drug use or controlled substance to Government agencies (DOT) concerned with national security, health and safety-sensitive. In these situations, the Pueblo will be required to remove the employee from a position involving national security, health, safety-sensitive, or confidential matters. If other work cannot be found, the employee may be subject to termination. Alcohol Use or Possession on Pueblo Premises The use, possession, sale, or distribution of alcohol on Pueblo premises, or in Pueblo-supplied vehicles, whether during working hours or nonworking hours,is prohibited and constitutes a violation of policy. Such action will be handled pursuant to the Pueblo's policy on work performance and conduct. Program Testing 1. The Pueblo will establish a testing program for alcohol, illegal drugs and controlled substances for all employees and will; in its sole discretion, determine and say at any time change the requirements, extent, and frequency of employee testing (with the exception of DOT requirements) upon approval from the San IIdefonso Tribal Council. 2. The Pueblo will test all applicants, whether new employees or rehires. The Pueblo requires that every newly hired and rehired employee be free of alcohol, illegal drug use and controlled substance abuse. Each offer of employment shall be conditioned upon the successful completion of a test for illegal drugs and controlled substances as prescribed by the Pueblo. The applicant's signature on the employment application is an agreement by that applicant to submit to pre-employment drug testing. Any applicant who tests positive in the pre-employment drug test shall be rejected and shall be ineligible for hire for 12months unless the applicant adequately establishes a legal basis for the use of the drug or controlled substance with respect to which the applicant tested positive. 3. Whenever the Pueblo, during the course of an investigation by its designated representative suspects or has reasonable suspicion that an employee has used illegal drugs or engaged in controlled substance abuse, whether during working hours or nonworking hours, on or off Pueblo premises, the Pueblo may require the employee to submit to a urine or other acceptable sample for testing, as prescribed by the Pueblo. 4. The Pueblo will afford applicants and employees subject to testing the opportunity, prior to testing, to list all prescription and nonprescription drugs and controlled substances they have used and to explain the circumstances surrounding the use of such drugs and controlled substances. Failure of any employee to establish adequately a legal basis for the use of any drug or controlled substance with respect to which the employee tests positive shall constitute a violation of policy. 5. Applicants and employees subject to testing must, prior to testing, sign an approved form agreeing to the testing, authorizing the release of test results to the Pueblo's designated representative, and authorizing the disclosure of the results by the designated representative to the Human Resources Department, the employee's supervisor, higher management, and other persons who have a bona-fide need to know. The designated representative will obtain the results of the analyses and communicate or disclose such results to the Human Resources Department, the employee's supervisor, higher management and any other person in accordance with the Pueblo's policies and procedures. 6. The Pueblo will establish and maintain any and all additional testing programs and requirements that may be necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable rules and regulations of all Government agencies including the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) requirements mandated by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Consequences for Violation of the Drug-Free Policy 1. Violation of this policy may result in severe disciplinary action, including termination, at the Pueblo's sole discretion. 2. In addition to any disciplinary action, the Pueblo may at its sole discretion, refer the employee to a treatment or counseling program (EAP) for illegal drug use or controlled substance abuse. Employees referred to such a program by the Pueblo must immediately cease any illegal drug use or controlled substance abuse, must comply with all other conditions of the treatment or counseling program and disciplinary action. After successful completion of all requirements of this section, employees will again be subject to the testing program applicable to all employees. Appropriate Pueblo representatives shall determine whether an employee referred for illegal drug use or controlled substance abuse treatment or counseling should be reassigned to another position. Individuals in safety-sensitive positions as defined by the Department of Transportation must be removed from these positions and reassigned to non-sensitive positions if a position is available, if not the employee may be terminated (see drug testing, step' 5). 3. The Pueblo will promptly terminate any employee who tests positive for illegal drugs or controlled substances, unless the employee establishes a legal basis for their use, if: a. Undergoing or after completion of treatment or counseling when such treatment or counseling is required by the Pueblo; b. The employee has tested positive for illegal drugs or controlled substances on a previous occasion; c. The employee has been referred at Pueblo request for treatment or counseling on a previous occasion. SUPERVISORY TRAINING (step 3) Purpose Supervisors are the key to a successful substance abuse program and therefore should be trained on all aspects of substance abuse and its effects in the work place. They have a legitimate right to initiate corrective actions when a worker's performance begins to decline. If it appears that personal problems including substance abuse may be impacting on performance, the use of constructive confrontation is one of the most effective ways known to get an employee to seek help. Confronting a worker about a performance problem can be constructive when a caring but firm attitude on the part of the supervisor is coupled with a referral to an appropriate source from which the employee can receive help for any personal problem. However, the supervisor's responsibility for monitoring job performance does not extend to diagnosing and resolving the personal problem. As the people in direct contact with workers, supervisors can detect performance problems that may indicate substance abuse. But their responsibilities should be limited, and that should be clearly explained to them. EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (EAP) (step 4) Employees who desire help with an alcohol or related problem may request assistance through the Pueblo's Human Resources Department or Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Assistance will be provided on a confidential basis, and each employee will be referred to the appropriate treatment and counseling services. Employees who voluntarily request assistance may do so without jeopardizing their continued employment with the Pueblo. Employees may utilize the benefits programs that the Pueblo recently implemented or be afforded the use of any recognized agency to identify the source of the problem and find practical solutions as quickly as possible. EAP services are available to the employee without charge, however, the cost of referrals to treatment or rehabilitation is the responsibility of the employee if the cost is not completely covered by insurance. In support of our drug-free workplace, our insurance plans include some coverage for the treatment of addiction. An employee who tests positive on an alcohol and/or drug test may be referred to the EAP for assessment and rehabilitation recommendations. The employee's decision to participate in the recommended treatment, successful completion of the program and additional treatment recommendations will be communicated to the organization. DRUG and ALCOHOL TESTING PROGRAM (step 5) Applicability The Pueblo has established the following procedures for drug and alcohol testing of all its employees, potential employees, contracted or otherwise. Specific Testing Requirements To ensure the Pueblos commitment to maintaining a drug-free work force and eliminate the use and abuse of drugs and alcohol in the work place, urine specimens will be collected and tested for the following specified drugs utilizing the DHHS cutoff levels (see definitions) to determine if a sample is positive. Substance Abuse Forensic Evaluation (SAFE) Non-DHHS 10+ drug/alcohol panel: Amphetamines, Cannabinoids, Cocaine, Phencyciidine(PCP), Barbiturates, Methadone, Opiates, Propoxyphene, Senzodiazepines, Methaqualone, and Alcohol (urine) Department of Health and Human Services DHHS/SAFE drug panel 5 (DOT): Amphetamines, Cannabinoids, Cocaine, Opiates, and Phencyclidine (PCP) E Evidential Breath Testing (EST) is also required by DOT--(all DOT safety-sensitive positions) Functions and Period of the Work Day Covered. Employees will only be tested for alcohol while they are at the work site. He or she is not subject to alcohol testing until an employee reports for work. Alcohol Concentration Pueblo employees may not report for duty or remain on duty in a position requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions while having an alcohol concentration of 0.04 Types of Testing The Pueblo will conduct illegal drug and controlled substance testing for the following instances: Pre-Placement /Pre-Employment (illegal drug and controlled substance only) Random Reasonable Cause Post Accident Return to Duty Follow up Pre-Placement/Pre Employment An applicant shall consent in writing (employment application) to illegal drug and controlled substance testing and successfully pass the test as a pre-qualification of employment. Implementation Procedures 1. All applicants will be notified in writing (employment application) that passing a drug and alcohol test shall be a condition for employment with the Pueblo. 2. Upon selection notification, the Human Resources Department will contact the Behavioral Health Program (collection site) to schedule an appointment and send the candidate(s) to the collection site. 3. The Pueblo will hire a candidate only when confirmation of a negative test result has been received by the Employee Assistance Coordinator (EAC) from the Medical Review Officer (MRO). 4. All persons will be tested under this category before being assigned to a safety-sensitive position from a non-safety sensitive position. 5. Records of all tests will be maintained at the Behavioral Health Program and remain confidential with access strictly on a \"need to know\" basis. Random Testing 1. A percentage equal to 25 percent of employees (50 percent for safety-sensitive positions) will be tested annually. 2. Random drawings will be done by the MRO on a quarterly basis. Post Accident Testing All employees employed by the Pueblo involved in or contributing to an accident, or who cannot be completely discounted as being contributing factors to an accident, shall be tested as soon as practicable after an accident. Employees in safety-sensitive positions must be tested for controlled substances no later than 32 hours after the accident and no later than 8 hours after the accident for alcohol testing as mandated by DOT. DOT places the burden .of compliance with post-accident alcohol and drug testing regulations on the individual in safety-sensitive positions and requires both a breath alcohol test and urine specimen. Individuals will be notified by their Program or the Human Resources Department to report to the EAC for testing. In the event that the individual is seriously injured and unable to provide a specimen at the time of the accident, he/she shall provide the necessary authorization for obtaining hospital reports and other documents that would indicate whether there were any controlled substances in his/her system. For the purposes of post accident testing, an \"accident\" is defined as an incident that results in property damage, death of a human being, or bodily injury to a person who, as a result of their injury, immediately receives medical treatment away from the scene of the accident. DOT regulations specify that except for a fatality accident, verification of responsibility of those individuals in safety-sensitive positions (i.e. truck drivers, bus drivers) in the above mentioned accident scenario must be established by a citation to the driver. Post Accident Procedures 1. An employee of the Pueblo must be tested if involved in an accident wherein the covered employee's performance either contributed to or cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident and the accident meets the definition criteria as described above. 2. The Pueblo/ supervisor will determine that post-accident testing will not be required by the employee if the Pueblo and/or Investigating Officer has determined that the employee's involvement was not a contributing factor in the accident. (Drivers may be hours away from an immediate supervisor. In such cases, the Pueblo/supervisor should call the enforcement agency involved and speak with the investigating officer or shift commander). 3. The Pueblo/supervisor is responsible to insure the employee reports to the Behavioral Health Program (collection site) in San Juan Pueblo after an appointment has been made with the EAC or a designated representative but no later than 32 hours after the accident for controlled substance testing and 8 hours after for alcohol testing when safety-sensitive positions are involved. Return to Duty When an employee is returned to duty after a rehabilitation process, the Pueblo will ensure the employee receives both an alcohol and controlled substance test before being reinstated to is/her previous job. A positive test will result in termination. Safety-sensitive positions must undergo a return-to-duty alcohol test with a result of less than a 0.02 BAC or receive a confirmed negative result from a controlled substance urinalysis test. Follow-Up testing When an employee is returned to duty after a rehabilitation process, the Pueblo will ensure the employee receives random alcohol and controlled substance tests over an 8-month period. The number and frequency of such follow-up testing shall be as directed by the MRO through the EAC. (Employee's in safety-sensitive positions will conduct at least six tests in the first 12 months following the employee's return to duty. Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 months from the date of the employee's return to duty). The EAC after discussion with the MRO may terminate the requirement for follow-up testing at any time after the first six tests have been administered, provided the EAC determines such testing is no longer necessary. DHHS/NIDA and SAFE Certified Laboratories All testing is performed by a DHHS/NIDA approved laboratory. The Pueblo has contracted with the following Laboratory to perform all its testing: S.E.D. Medical Laboratories 5601 Office Blvd N.E. Albuquerque, New Mexico 87109 800-999-LABS (5227) S.E.D. Laboratories in Albuquerque holds dual forensic drug testing certifications: Department of Health and Human Services (formerly NIDA) required for federally regulated testing, and Forensic Urine Drug Testing by the College of American Pathologists (CAP-FUDT). Routine Laboratory inspections and periodic testing challenges is required for ongoing certification and to assure and maintain quality control. Copies of these certifications are available to the Pueblo upon request. The Pueblo has contracted the following Medical Review Officer (MRO) through S.ED. Medical Labs: Dr. Renee Gonzalez 101 Hospital Loop. NE Suite 215 Albuquerque, New Mexico 87109 505-291-5444 Collections Collections will be done at the Behavioral Health Program located in San Juan Pueblo (#505/852-2788). The Employee Assistance Coordinator (EAC) and or designated representative will conduct specimen collections and ensure chain of custody procedures in accordance with procedures established by the testing laboratory. The standard legal protocol checklist for SAFE drug screen collections will be utilized for both standard and split-sample collections. S.E.D. Labs provides a bonded courier service for collections pickup Monday through Friday to transfer the specimen from the collection point to and from the laboratory. They also provide all testing supplies (800999-LABS). Negative drug test results are available within 24 hours of the time the specimen arrives at the Laboratory in Albuquerque. Positive screening tests require confirmatory testing which require an additional 24-48 hours. These results are sent to the MRO. The MRO will contact the employee(s) who have positive drug testing results to determine if the result is due to prescription drugs. The MRO will then either call or FAX results to the Behavioral Health Program followed by written results sent by mail. Positive results will be reviewed by the EAC and forwarded to the Human Resources Director for consultation with the employees Program Director. A referral can then be made to the Pueblo's EAP (based on previous substance abuse history) or potential termination of employment. Employees in safety-sensitive positions as defined by DOT will be required to do a split-pecimen (see definitions &amp; DOT procedures). 703. Harassment Policy The Pueblo will not permit or tolerate harassment of employees by other employees. This includes harassment because of race, sex, religious, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, disability or medical condition, age, or any other basis protected by federal law. Such conduct by an employee could result in corrective action up to, and including termination of employment. No harassment will be tolerated and sexual, racial, religious, ethnic, disability, sexual orientation and other form of legally impermissible harassment in any manner or form is expressly prohibited. If an employee becomes aware of inappropriate harassment in the workplace whether directed at himself/herself or any other person, they have an obligation to bring it to the attention of their director, the Tribal Administrator, Human Resources Coordinator or any other Pueblo official with whom they are comfortable discussing the issue. The situation will then be investigated appropriately and privacy will be maintained to the extent feasible under the circumstances. Retaliation against any individual who complains about an incident of harassment or cooperates in any investigation of alleged harassment is strictly prohibited. 704. Progressive Discipline The purpose of this policy is to state the Pueblo of San Ildefonso's position on administering equitable and consistent discipline for unsatisfactory conduct in the workplace. The Pueblo's own best interest lies in ensuring fair treatment of all employees and in making certain that disciplinary actions are prompt, uniform and impartial. The major purpose of any disciplinary action is to correct the problem, prevent recurrence, and prepare the employee for satisfactory service in the future. Although employment with the Pueblo is based on mutual consent and both the Employee and the Pueblo have the right to terminate employment at will, with or without cause or advance notice, the Pueblo shall use progressive discipline for those activities or conduct that do not require immediate termination. Progressive disciplinary action should include these four steps: 1. Verbal Interview - When an employee violates any rules or regulations mentioned in this Policy or for some other reason requires Management attention, the first step may be in the form of a verbal interview, initiated by the employee's Director. The Director will develop a memorandum documenting the verbal interview and route as follows: the original notice to the employee, then a copy to Tribal Administrator, and then another copy to the employee's personnel file. The intention of the verbal interview is to discuss and suggest corrective actions for the employee's job performance. 2. Written Warning Notice - When an employee violates any rules or regulations mentioned in this Policy and/or has been given a verbal notice or for some other reason warrants immediate Management attention, The employee's Director will develop a notice that describe the nature of the violation and route as follows: the original notice to the employee, then a copy to Tribal Administrator, and then another copy to the employee's personnel file. The written notice will outline corrective actions to be made within the specific time frame. Successful completion of these corrective actions will be documented and added to the employee's personnel file. 3. Suspension Without Pay - A Director may suspend an employee without pay. A hearing shall be scheduled, with the Governor or his designee, for the third working day after the employee's formal notification of suspension. The Director, the Human Resources Coordinator, the employee, the Tribal Administrator, and the Governor should be present for the hearing. The employee shall not be suspended for more than (3) working days. No Department of the Tribe shall hire the suspended employee during the suspension period. The hearing shall determine whether or not the employee will be retained or terminated. The employee shall receive a written notice of the suspension and records will be routed in the following manner: one copy for the employee's Director, one copy for the Tribal Administrator and one copy for the employee's personnel file. 4. Termination of Employment Involuntary - A Director may request termination for any of the following actions or omissions including but not limited to: Theft or attempted theft, including the unauthorized removal of Pueblo property; Omission, falsification, misuse, or manipulation of information on employment applications, time sheets, or other Pueblo records; Malicious abuse of Pueblo equipment or property; Absence for three (3) consecutive working days without proper notification; Possession or use of alcoholic beverages or illegal drugs during working hours, or appearing for work duty under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs; Harassment of any type as a threat or action against any person during working hours; Unauthorized possession of firearms, weapons, or explosives; Conviction of any crime for which the employee is subject to a jail term or which brings unfavorable publicity to the Pueblo; Gross professional negligence; Unauthorized public statements or release of confidential information; Fighting or attempting to injure others during working hours; Repeated violations of any written part of the Personnel Policy; Initiating malicious gossip which injures another employee's professional reputation; and/or Where the continuing employment of the employee would cause the Pueblo or specific program continuing harm. The Director will notify the employee in writing of the reasons for his or her termination immediately after obtaining the Tribal Administrator's concurrence, and termination, which will take effect immediately. The Tribal Administrator will use this same procedure for directors. Employees terminated will be paid for any salary due, plus unused annual leave (up to 240 hours until 2009) upon submission of a signed or approved clearance form by their immediate supervisor and the Human Resources Director (see Sections 504 and 505). An employee may be involuntarily terminated if physical or mental impairment prevent the employee's performance of required duties. Termination, due to mental or physical disability must be supported by medical evidence acceptable to the immediate supervisor. 705. Grievances and Appeals A grievance, as established in this policy shall be defined as an employee's unresolved dissatisfaction with any aspect of working conditions (except involuntary termination) or working relationships which are brought to the attention of the immediate Director. The employee filing the grievance shall be free from restraint, coercion, discrimination, or reprisal. Probationary employees cannot file grievances. Grievance Procedure 1. Aggrieved employees must go through all the following steps when filing a grievance or appealing a grievance decision: Step A: An employee shall file a written grievance with their Director within ten (10) calendar days following the incident causing the Grievance. A meeting shall be held between the employee and the Director within five (5) calendar days following the submission of a grievance. The Director shall make their recommendation, in writing, within three (3) Calendar days after the meeting and notify the aggrieved employee in person or by certified mail. Step B: If the employee is not satisfied with the decision or if the Director fails to act within the specified time, the employee may appeal the decision and file a grievance with the Tribal Administrator. Filing must take place within five (5) calendar days after Director's decision or, in case of no action, five (5) calendar days after the final day of the Director's decision-making time limit. A meeting shall be held between the aggrieved employee and the Directors superior within five (5) calendar days after the re-filing or appeal. The Director's superior must make their recommendation in writing, within three (3) calendar days after the hearing and notify the aggrieved employee either personally or by certified mail. Step C : If the employee is not satisfied with the decision or if the Tribal Administrator fails to act within the specified time; the employee may appeal the decision and file a grievance with the Grievance Committee. Filing must take place within five (5) calendar days after the Tribal Administrator's decision or, in case of no action, five (5) calendar days after the final day of the decision making time limit. A meeting shall be held between the aggrieved employee, Director, Human Resources Coordinator, and the Grievance Committee within five (5) days of filing. At this meeting, any party may present witnesses. The Grievance Committee shall make its recommendation in writing within three (3) calendar days of the meeting and notify the aggrieved employee in person or by certified mail. 2. An Ad Hoc Grievance Committee will be established for purposes of hearing grievances as described herein. The Ad Hoc Grievance Committee shall consist of two (2) Directors and three (3) Tribal Councilmen. The Tribal Administrator will appoint committee members as needed. If the Tribal Administrator is involved in the dispute, the Governor will appoint the committee members. 3. A grievance shall not exist until such time that an employee makes known to the Director that employment dissatisfaction exists. The complaints shall be in writing and must be specific and reinforced with factual evidence. The employee filing a grievance shall be required to be present at each proceeding of their case. If the aggrieved employee fails to be present at the agreed upon location, time and date for the meeting, the Grievance Committee's decision on the case shall not be delayed. 4. Since it is important that grievances and appeals be resolved as rapidly as possible, time limits provided shall be considered as maximum and every effort shall be made to expedite the process. However, time limits may be extended or shortened if both parties agree in writing. In the event the last day of a time limit falls on a weekend or a legal holiday, as defined herein, the time limit shall include the next working day as well. The decision of the Grievance Committee shall be final, and there is no process for appeal to the Tribal Administration or Tribal Council. If an aggrieved employee fails to file, re-file, or appeal within the prescribed or mutually agree upon time limits, they cannot precede any further in the process. The matter shall be closed, with the previous decision, if any, considered binding. 5. Employees are required to appear as witnesses in Grievances and Appeals hearings when requested by the aggrieved employee, the person against whom the grievance is filed, or the person hearing the grievance or appeal.

(d) In 2007, the Pueblo received and will administer a direct grant under the EPA in the amount of $783,000, which will be allocated towards drilling a 1,200 ft deep well in Pajarito ($650,00) and renovating existing Main Village Wells #1 and #2 ($133,000). (e) On April 6, 2010, Indian Health Services (IHS) presented to the Tribal Council and recommended reducing MCL levels by developing a new well on the Ease side of the Rio Grande and pumping water to Pajarito via boring locations under the Rio Grande. (f) In September 2010, the Pueblo requested assistance from IHS to engineer and oversee construction of video inspection, pump testing, and water quality testing of Main Village Wells #1 and #2. (g) The Pueblo and IHS entered into a Memorandum of Agreement under HIS project, AL 10-110 for this scope of work. (h) In March 2011, IHS helped the Pueblo secure an additional $800,000 from EPA SWDA funding to construct a new well, pumphouse booster, station, and water main extension to Pajarito under the Rio Grande through IHS project Al 11-115. (i) Based on video inspection, pump testing, and water quality testing of Main Village Wells #1 and #2 completed in March 2011, it was determined that these new wells should not be used and a new community well should be drilled. (j) In October 2011, IHS utilized their government contract with Bohannan-Huston Inc. to have a hydrogeological study performed to site the best location for a new community well. (k) The hydrogeological study recommended drilling a new exploratory well and production well approximately 850 feet north of the existing Black Mesa Well, which will increase water system reliability and provide sufficient water supply for both the Main Village and Pajarito communities. (l) Well construction began in July 2012 and is now nearly complete, HIS is sizing the new well pump, and the hydrogeologist has completed a 95% draft report on the well. (m) The EPA has indicated that the direct grant ($783,000) funds will expire on October 31, 2013 and that if they are not spent, EPA will have to cancel the grant and the remaining funds will be used for a different project. (n) IHS is working with the Pueblo and The EPA to try to spend as much of the grant direct funds as possibly before they expire. (o) IHS has proposed designs to the Pueblo for a water main from the new pumphouse near Black Mesa Well #2 and a water main extension from the new pumphouse to connect to the existing water system. (p) The Pueblo held to noticed community meetings on June 26, 2013 and July 11, 2013 to address impacts to tribal members' assigned lands along the water main route. (q) At the June 26, 2013 community meeting, tribal members with assigned property along the water main route requested changes and a revised route was designed as shown on the attached map. (r) No changes to the new route were requested at the community meeting held on July 11, 2013. (s) The Pueblo finds that it is in the best interest of the Pueblo to move forward with the route proposed at the June 26, 2011 meeting.

(b) Verde approached the Pueblo for the purpose of entering into negotiations for a right-of-way and permission to construct the new line. (c) Many details of the proposed project, including the specific alignment to be followed by the line over tribal lands, must be negotiated by the Pueblo's representatives and considered by the Council. (d) The Pueblo has decided to carry out negotiations of the project in two phases. (e) On October 10, 2012, the Council adopted Council Resolution No SI-R12-030 (Oct. 12, 2012), which expressed interest in the Verde Project subject to the development of a proposed route acceptable to the Pueblo and authorized Verde to conduct a land survey for the proposed transmission corridor under the first phase of the project. (f) Pursuant to Council Resolution No. SI-R12-030, the Governor has established a Pueblo negotiating team to work with Verde to review and analyze the project and determine a suitable route for the transmission lines. (g) The second phase of the project will involve final negotiation of the right-of-way. (h) Based on land surveys Verde has proposed three different route alternatives for the Pueblo's consideration: (1) Route Alternative 1 \u2013 Parallel to existing 115 kV line. (2) Route Alternative 2 \u2013 Along the northern and most of the eastern boundary of the Pueblo, entirely within Pueblo lands. (3) Route Alternative 3 - Along the eastern boundary of the Pueblo, including private lands within the exterior boundaries.

{"body": "Pueblo de San Ildefonso Code. 24.2.5.010 Findings (a) In early 2012, the Pueblo and Jemez Mountains Electric Cooperative, Inc. (JMEC) negotiated a settlement for three expired rights-of-way across the Pueblo's lands and the renewal for the substation properties in a global settlement that included both the past due amounts and future payments for all of the JMEC rights-of-way and substation lease under a new rights-of-way agreement for a 25 year term. (b) The \"Rights of Way, Lease and Trespass Settlement Agreement\" dated February 11, 2012 provided for payment of $5,998,695 over 25 years for 74.73 acres based on a value of $3211.09 per acre. (c) JMEC filed various Rate Riders with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (\"PRC\") in order to recover the cost of rights-of-way across several different Pueblos' lands. (d) The initial proposed rate increase filed with the PRC for the recovery of the costs for the Pueblo's rights of way was based on revised acreage amounts for JMEC Facilities on San Ildefonso lands of 78.43 acres. (e) Rate Rider No. 4 as initially filed could have raised the electric bills for JMEC customers residing within the Pueblo's boundaries by as much as 50% and such an increase would have caused an economic hardship to both tribal and non-tribal residents. (f) The Pueblo agreed to mediation in an effort to find ways to reduce the impact of the rate increase. (g) Pueblo and JMEC representatives met numerous times to reevaluate the routes, acreage, and type of electric facilities in a good faith effort to reduce the electric rate increase while still maintaining the Pueblo's right to compensation for rights of way over its lands. (h) The Pueblo has proposed to have several local distribution lines be subject to service line agreements rather than a right of way agreement, thereby removing those lines from the total right of way acreage amount subject to compensation. (i) reducing the amount of local distribution line acreage will result in the Pueblo receiving less compensation for the right of way across its lands but it will have the beneficial effect of reducing the rate increase for all JMEC customers within the Pueblo's boundaries. (j) The Council has been continuously informed of the proposed negotiations regarding the right-of-way and the rate increase matters and has determined that it is in the Pueblo's best interest to amend the right of way agreement with JMEC to maintain the value per acre of $3211.09 and reduce the right of way acreage from 74.73 acres in the initial agreement to 58.19 acres. (k) The Council understands that the reduction in acreage will result in the Pueblo forgoing approximately $53,111 annually and $1,327,785 over the life of the 25 year right of way agreement term. (l) The Council has determined it is in the best interest of the Pueblo and its residents, both tribal and non-tribal, to amend the right of way agreement in order to reduce the economic impact for JMEC customers within its boundaries as a result of rate recovery actions.

(b) On October 6, 2017, the Pueblo and DOE/NNSA executed a new Right-of-Way Agreement for the Norton Line, the term of which will begin August 1, 2018. (c) In the process of reviewing a new survey for the Right-of-Way area for the Norton Line (\"Initial Survey\"), it was discovered that the boundary of the Pueblo's lands which had been used as the end line of the previous Right-of-Way descriptions for the Norton Line had changed due to the natural meandering of the Rio Grande River. (d) The change in the Pueblo's eastern boundary increases the total acreage of the Norton Line Right-of-Way as the 115 kV electric transmission line crosses over the Rio Grande River and the eastern boundary of the Right-of-Way has been tied to the boundary of the Rio Grande River. (e) 25 CFR Part 169.102 requires an accurate legal description of the right-of-way and its boundaries and definite location of the right-of-way. (f) The Pueblo obtained a Supplemental Survey for the area ending at the eastern end of the Initial Survey and the new medial line of the Rio Grande River. The Supplemental Survey reflects the additional acreage and changed eastern boundary for the Norton Line Right-of-Way that resulted from the meandering of the Rio Grande River. (g) The Council acknowledges that the boundaries and acreage for the Norton Line Right-of-Way for purposes of the Right-of-Way Agreement shall consist of the boundary, acreage, and legal descriptions contained in both the Initial Survey and the Supplemental Survey. The Initial Survey Right-of-Way area consists of 29.41 acres and the Supplemental Survey Right-of Way area consists of 0.629 acres for a total acreage of 30.04 acres, more or less. (h) Pursuant to the Right-of-Way Agreement, the Pueblo and DOE/NNSA had agreed upon compensation in the amount of $4,663,621 for the Right-of-Way and the Council, by SI-R18-006, determined it was in the Pueblo's best interest to accept the agreed upon compensation and to waive the valuation pursuant to 25 CFR \u00a7169.110(a). (i) The Council determines that it is in the best interest of the Pueblo not to require additional compensation from DOE/NNSA for the additional acreage resulting from the changed Right-of-Way boundary.

(l) The Council acknowledges that time is of the essence to submit the completed Right-of-Way package to the BIA for approval, and acknowledges that the Governor and the DOE representative, in the interest of addressing the unusual situation involving the changed boundaries and increased acreage as quickly as possible, had the opportunity to sign the proposed Amendment to Right-of-Way Agreement, with the understanding that the Council must approve the Amendment and ratify the Governor's signature of the document to be effective.

{"body": "Pueblo de San Ildefonso Code. 24.5.1.010 Findings On April 12, 2000, the Council adopted Ordinance NO. SI-R00-001, establishing the Northern Pueblos Housing Authority (\"NPHA\"). (a) NPHA is the Tribally Designated Housing Entity (\"TDHE\") for the Pueblo, established by the Pueblo pursuant to \u00a7 4(18) and (21) of the Native American Housing and Self Determination Act of 1996, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4401 et seq. (\"NAHASDA\") for developing, operating, and managing housing units assisted by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"). (b) The Pueblo has a shortage of affordable housing and it is critical to build new housing for income eligible tribal members. (c) On January 29 th , 2009, the Council approved, through Resolution No. SI-R09-002, the donation of a 25 year renewable land-lease to the NPHA, known as Tract 1, Deer Tail Vista. (d) NPHA developed a proposal for development of a ten-lot duplex housing project to be located in the Deer Tail Vista Subdivision (\"Project\"). (e) On October 2010 an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Project was prepared by WHPacific for NPHA and HUD. (f) On March 16, 2011, HUD completed a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) for the Project. (g) In 2011 the Council reviewed the Project proposal and determined that it was to the best interest of the Pueblo to construct single housing units to avoid future problems between tenants. (h) On May 16 th , 2011, through Resolution No SI-R11-013, and on November 21 st 2011, through Resolution No. SI-R11-034, the Council authorized the NPHA to apply for 2011 and 2012 Indian Community Development Block Grants respectively, on behalf of the Pueblo of financing of the Project. (i) On January 23, 2012 the United States Department of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs (\"BIA\"), Northern Pueblo's Agency posted a Notice of Availability of Environmental Assessment and completed a FONSI for the Project. (j) Souder, Miller &amp; Associates of Albuquerque completed a survey plat titled \"DEER TAIL VISTA, LOTS 1-10 WITHIN A PORTION OF TRACTS 1 &amp; 2, DEER TAIL VISTA IN SECTIONS 6, T, 19N, N.M.P.M. IN THE SAN ILDEFONSO GRANT, SANTA FE COUNTY, NEW MEXICO. (k) The survey plat was reviewed by the Pueblo and submitted to the BLM Indian land Surveyor of the BIA, Southwest Regional Office for review and was accepted on December 4, 2012. (l) On December 12 th , 2011, the Council, through Resolution No. SI-R11-038, authorized NPHA to apply for a HUD Title VI Loan Guarantee for the Project and authorized NPHA and the Pueblo to enter into a contract amongst HUD, the Pueblo and NPHA. (m) The Pueblo has used master residential leases in the past. (n) A master lease provides only a legal description of the perimeter of the property and not for individual lots. (o) Subsequent conveyance of units to homebuyers under the master lease was administratively complex because it required a survey of the individual unit, a request to the Pueblo to partition the lease, approval of the partition by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and then final Pueblo and BIA approval for unit conveyance. (p) Individual residential leases for each residential lot simplifies the conveyance process because only NPHA's quitclaim of its interest and final approval by the Pueblo and the BIA is required. (q) For the purpose of construction of the Project, NPHA is requesting from the Pueblo fifty (50) year leasehold interests in ten residential lots, more specifically described in proposed leases, copies of which are attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. (r) In support of this Project, the Pueblo will contribute to the Project leasehold interests in the above-mentioned parcels of land in the form of Bureau of Indian Affairs approved and recorded Residential Leases of Tribally Owned Land. (s) NPHA has requested that the Pueblo execute an Environmental Review Record (ERR) reaffirming acceptance of the Environmental Review for the Project and authorizing NPHA to use up to $849,280 in previously committed and Pueblo-approved IHBG funds for Project construction.

(b) Rate Rider No. 4 as initially filed could have raised the electric bills for JMEC customers residing within the Pueblo's boundaries by as much as 50% and such an increase would have caused an economic hardship to both tribal and non-tribal residents.

(d) Pueblo and JMEC representatives met numerous times to reevaluate the routes, acreage, and type of electric facilities in a good faith effort to reduce the electric rate increase. (e) In keeping within the limitations of Rate 19, the Pueblo has proposed to have several local distribution lines be subject to service line agreements rather than a right of way agreement, thereby removing those lines from the total right of way acreage amount subject to compensation.

(b) Rate Rider No. 4 as initially filed could have raised the electric bills for JMEC customers within the Pueblo's boundaries by as much as 50% and such an increase would have caused an economic hardship to both tribal and non-tribal customers.

(d) Pueblo and JMEC representatives met numerous times to reevaluate the routes, acreage, and type of electric facilities in a good faith effort to reduce the amount of electric rate increase.

{"body": "Pueblo de San Ildefonso Code. 24.7.3.030 Findings The Council hereby finds and declares that: (a) The Pueblo has been dealing with issues of roads trespass for decades and the number of unauthorized roads and the amount of unauthorized access over the Pueblo's lands has reached an unacceptable level. (b) The Pueblo has attempted several times to negotiate with Santa Fe County (County) to address the issue of unauthorized roads within the Pueblo's lands. (c) In 2015, the County issued a resolution stating that it would not sign a contributed funding agreement (CFA) for its share of the costs for the regional water system required under the Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act, P.L. 111-291, until it knew the cost to resolve the roads trespass claims of all four of the Pueblos of Nambe, Pojoaque, San Ildefonso and Tesuque who are parties to the Aamodt water rights settlement. (d) In June of 2017, the Pueblo, along with the three other Pueblos and the County, were brought together to attempt to resolve the roads matter so that the County could sign a CFA with the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) for its share of funding for the regional water system. (e) The Pueblo, the County and representatives of the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and BOR engaged in extensive negotiations over several months on the roads issues within San Ildefonso Pueblo. (f) The Pueblo, County and the Department of the Interior reached a compromise solution that addresses the Pueblo's concern about unlawful roads and unlawful access over the Pueblo's lands while providing long-term insurable access to private land within the Pueblo's lands at specific locations on identified roads. (g) The proposed settlement will also allow the Pueblo to identify its boundaries and prevent future unauthorized encroachment onto Pueblo lands with the construction of two new roads. (h) The Council has been apprised of the proposed settlement terms and agrees with the following negotiated key terms: (1) The County will construct two (2) new roads, Yellow Bird Loop and Blue Dove, at the County's sole expense. (2) The placement CMR 84, CMR 84A, CMR 84B, and CR 101D, and the new roads, on the BIA Tribal Transportation Program Inventory (TTPI) and the grant of road rights-of-way (ROW) to the BIA for an initial 99-year term with an automatic renewal of a second 99-year term (198 years total). (3) The \"gap\" issues where there is a gap of Pueblo land between a road a private lot will be addressed by the construction of the new roads and any remaining gaps will be included in the BIA ROWs as designated access points, provided the Pueblo will not maintain any gap or private drive to a road. (4) The County will survey the road ROWs and access points for private lots, and conduct required archeological and environmental assessments, at its expense. (5) The Pueblo will legislatively grant temporary access to private lands off of identified roads for a term of five (5) years or until the ROWs are granted for the current roads or the new roads are constructed; provided, this does not grant authorized access off of roads of convenience. (6) The County will maintain the roads under a maintenance agreement with the BIA and the Pueblo for the duration of the road ROWs. (7) The County will not issue road cut permits for installation of utilities for any road in the TTPI and the Pueblo has the sole authority to grant utility easements along those roads. The Pueblo agrees to use a standard appraisal method for valuation of utility ROWs for the specific portion of CMR 84B and CMR 84 starting at the end of the pavement on 84B (Latitude = 35\u00b053'34.4633\" North, Longitude = 106\u00b006'49.7068\" West) running approximately 2.44 miles to eastern Pueblo grant boundary (Latitude = 35\u00b053'13.58\" North, Longitude = 106\u00b004'24.09\" West). (8) The roads will be renamed by the Pueblo in a phased approach. (9) The Pueblo and County agree to cooperate to identify designated access points or common access points. (10) The County will require access solely through legal access points for future development on private land. (i) Litigation on the roads matter would be very costly and would further divide the community and by negotiating a compromise settlement, the Pueblo avoids the uncertainty and great expense of litigation to resolve the roads dispute. (j) The Council finds that it is in best interest of the Pueblo to finally resolve the long-standing roads dispute with the County and approve a Settlement Agreement that will provide a long-term solution to the roads issues within San Ildefonso Pueblo lands.

Purpose The purpose of this Act is to authorize amendment of the Right-of-Way Agreement previously signed on October 6, 2017 between the Pueblo and the Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration (\"DOE/NNSA\") for a new right-of-way the Norton Electric Transmission Line (\"Norton Line\"). The Act sets out the amended terms of the Right-of-Way Agreement for the changed eastern Right-of-Way boundary and increased acreage of the Right-of-Way for the Norton Line. New &lt;a class=\"no-wrap\" href=\"/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/24.2.8.030\"&gt;Section 24.2.8.030&lt;/a&gt; Section 1.3. Findings The Council hereby finds and declares that: (a) The Pueblo and DOE/NNSA entered into a 1998 Grant of Easement for Right-of- Way for Electric Lines for the 115 kV electric transmission line, known as the Norton Line, which easement expires on July 31, 2018. (b) On October 6, 2017, the Pueblo and DOE/NNSA executed a new Right-of-Way Agreement for the Norton Line, the term of which will begin August 1, 2018. (c) In the process of reviewing a new survey for the Right-of-Way area for the Norton Line (\"Initial Survey\"), it was discovered that the boundary of the Pueblo's lands which had been used as the end line of the previous Right-of-Way descriptions for the Norton Line had changed due to the natural meandering of the Rio Grande River. (d) The change in the Pueblo's eastern boundary increases the total acreage of the Norton Line Right-of-Way as the 115 kV electric transmission line crosses over the Rio Grande River and the eastern boundary of the Right-of-Way has been tied to the boundary of the Rio Grande River. (e) 25 CFR Part 169.102 requires an accurate legal description of the right-of-way and its boundaries and definite location of the right-of-way. (f) The Pueblo obtained a Supplemental Survey for the area ending at the eastern end of the Initial Survey and the new medial line of the Rio Grande River. The Supplemental Survey reflects the additional acreage and changed eastern boundary for the Norton Line Right-of-Way that resulted from the meandering of the Rio Grande River. (g) The Council acknowledges that the boundaries and acreage for the Norton Line Right-of-Way for purposes of the Right-of-Way Agreement shall consist of the boundary, acreage, and legal descriptions contained in both the Initial Survey and the Supplemental Survey. The Initial Survey Right-of-Way area consists of 29.41 acres and the Supplemental Survey Right-of Way area consists of 0.629 acres for a total acreage of 30.04 acres, more or less. (h) Pursuant to the Right-of-Way Agreement, the Pueblo and DOE/NNSA had agreed upon compensation in the amount of $4,663,621 for the Right-of-Way and the Council, by SI-R18-006, determined it was in the Pueblo's best interest to accept the agreed upon compensation and to waive the valuation pursuant to 25 CFR \u00a7169.110(a). (i) The Council determines that it is in the best interest of the Pueblo not to require additional compensation from DOE/NNSA for the additional acreage resulting from the changed Right-of-Way boundary. (j) The Council, having reviewed the Amendment to Right-of-Way document, attached hereto, finds approval of the Amendment is in the best interest of the Pueblo. (k) The Council acknowledges that all other terms of the October 6, 2017 Right-of-Way Agreement remain in full force and effect. (l) The Council acknowledges that time is of the essence to submit the completed Right-of-Way package to the BIA for approval, and acknowledges that the Governor and the DOE representative, in the interest of addressing the unusual situation involving the changed boundaries and increased acreage as quickly as possible, had the opportunity to sign the proposed Amendment to Right-of-Way Agreement, with the understanding that the Council must approve the Amendment and ratify the Governor's signature of the document to be effective.

Authorizations (a) The Council approves the attached Amendment to Right-of-Way Agreement. (b) The Council hereby authorizes and ratifies the Governor's May 22, 2018 signature of the Amendment to Right-of Way Agreement document.

Short Title This enactment shall be known as the \"ACT AUTHORIZING SIGNATURE OF ROADS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.\" New &lt;a class=\"no-wrap\" href=\"/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/24.7.3.020\"&gt;Section 24.7.3.020&lt;/a&gt; Section 1.2. Purpose The purpose of this Act is to approve the proposed Settlement Agreement with Santa Fe County and the Department of the Interior on the roads trespass claims and to authorize Governor to sign the Settlement Agreement. New &lt;a class=\"no-wrap\" href=\"/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/24.7.3.030\"&gt;Section 24.7.3.030&lt;/a&gt; Section 1.3. Findings The Council hereby finds and declares that: (a) The Pueblo has been dealing with issues of roads trespass for decades and the number of unauthorized roads and the amount of unauthorized access over the Pueblo's lands has reached an unacceptable level. (b) The Pueblo has attempted several times to negotiate with Santa Fe County (County) to address the issue of unauthorized roads within the Pueblo's lands. (c) In 2015, the County issued a resolution stating that it would not sign a contributed funding agreement (CFA) for its share of the costs for the regional water system required under the Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act, P.L. 111-291, until it knew the cost to resolve the roads trespass claims of all four of the Pueblos of Nambe, Pojoaque, San Ildefonso and Tesuque who are parties to the Aamodt water rights settlement. (d) In June of 2017, the Pueblo, along with the three other Pueblos and the County, were brought together to attempt to resolve the roads matter so that the County could sign a CFA with the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) for its share of funding for the regional water system. (e) The Pueblo, the County and representatives of the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and BOR engaged in extensive negotiations over several months on the roads issues within San Ildefonso Pueblo. (f) The Pueblo, County and the Department of the Interior reached a compromise solution that addresses the Pueblo's concern about unlawful roads and unlawful access over the Pueblo's lands while providing long-term insurable access to private land within the Pueblo's lands at specific locations on identified roads. (g) The proposed settlement will also allow the Pueblo to identify its boundaries and prevent future unauthorized encroachment onto Pueblo lands with the construction of two new roads. (h) The Council has been apprised of the proposed settlement terms and agrees with the following negotiated key terms: 1. The County will construct two (2) new roads, Yellow Bird Loop and Blue Dove, at the County's sole expense. 2. The placement CMR 84, CMR 84A, CMR 84B, and CR 101D, and the new roads, on the BIA Tribal Transportation Program Inventory (TTPI) and the grant of road rights-of-way (ROW) to the BIA for an initial 99-year term with an automatic renewal of a second 99-year term (198 years total). 3. The \"gap\" issues where there is a gap of Pueblo land between a road a private lot will be addressed by the construction of the new roads and any remaining gaps will be included in the BIA ROWs as designated access points, provided the Pueblo will not maintain any gap or private drive to a road. 4. The County will survey the road ROWs and access points for private lots, and conduct required archeological and environmental assessments, at its expense. 5. The Pueblo will legislatively grant temporary access to private lands off of identified roads for a term of five (5) years or until the ROWs are granted for the current roads or the new roads are constructed; provided, this does not grant authorized access off of roads of convenience. 6. The County will maintain the roads under a maintenance agreement with the BIA and the Pueblo for the duration of the road ROWs. 7. The County will not issue road cut permits for installation of utilities for any road in the TTPI and the Pueblo has the sole authority to grant utility easements along those roads. The Pueblo agrees to use a standard appraisal method for valuation of utility ROWs for the specific portion of CMR 84B and CMR 84 starting at the end of the pavement on 84B (Latitude = 35\u00b053'34.4633\" North, Longitude = 106\u00b006'49.7068\" West) running approximately 2.44 miles to eastern Pueblo grant boundary (Latitude = 35\u00b053'13.58\" North, Longitude = 106\u00b004'24.09\" West). 8. The roads will be renamed by the Pueblo in a phased approach. 9. The Pueblo and County agree to cooperate to identify designated access points or common access points. 10. The County will require access solely through legal access points for future development on private land. (i) Litigation on the roads matter would be very costly and would further divide the community and by negotiating a compromise settlement, the Pueblo avoids the uncertainty and great expense of litigation to resolve the roads dispute. (j) The Council finds that it is in best interest of the Pueblo to finally resolve the long-standing roads dispute with the County and approve a Settlement Agreement that will provide a long-term solution to the roads issues within San Ildefonso Pueblo lands.

The Council hereby approves the Settlement Agreement in substantially the same form as attached hereto. 2. The Council hereby grants a limited waiver of the Pueblo's sovereign immunity for suits limited only to interpretation or enforcement of the Settlement Agreement by a court of competent jurisdiction. 3.

Title This enactment shall be known as \"ACT RESCINDING THE DELEGATION OF THE PUEBLO DE SAN ILDEFONSO'S GOVERNANCE AUTHORITY OVER THE SANTA FE INDIAN SCHOOL TRUST LANDS.\" New &lt;a class=\"no-wrap\" href=\"/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/2.3.9.020\"&gt;Section 2.3.9.020&lt;/a&gt; Section 1.2. Definitions (a) \"AISD\" shall mean the Albuquerque Indian School District, a political subdivision established by the 19 Pueblos as joint owners of the trust lands in Albuquerque held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the 19 Pueblos. (b) \"Council\" shall mean the Council of the Pueblo de San Ildefonso. (c) \"Governor\" shall mean the Governor of the Pueblo de San Ildefonso. (d) \"Pueblo\" shall mean the Pueblo de San Ildefonso. (e) \"SFIS\" shall mean the Santa Fe Indian School, a school owned and operated by the 19 Pueblos and which the Pueblo is a 1/19 owner. (f) \"SFIS, Inc.\" shall mean the Santa Fe Indian School, Inc., a non-profit entity established by the 19 Pueblos for the operation of the SFIS. (g) \"SFIS Trust Lands\" shall mean the approximately 115 acres of land, which includes the Santa Fe Indian School (\"SFIS\"), taken into trust by the U.S. for the benefit of the 19 Pueblos (\"the SFIS Trust Lands\") pursuant to Santa Fe Indian School Act, 114 Stat. 2868, (2000). New &lt;a class=\"no-wrap\" href=\"/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/2.3.9.030\"&gt;Section 2.3.9.030&lt;/a&gt; Section 1.3. Purpose The purpose of this law is to rescind the Council's previous delegation of governance authority over the SFIS Trust Lands that was delegated to the Governor as a member of the AISD Governing Council and for the Pueblo to reassume and reserve all of the Pueblo's governance authority over the SFIS Trust Lands. New &lt;a class=\"no-wrap\" href=\"/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/2.3.9.040\"&gt;Section 2.3.9.040&lt;/a&gt; Section 1.4. Findings The Council hereby finds and declares that: (a) The sovereign authority of the Pueblo is vested in its Council and Governor. (b) Pursuant to the Santa Fe Indian School Act, 114 Stat. 2868, (2000), the Santa Fe Indian School Trust Lands consisting of approximately 115 acres of land, which includes the SFIS, were taken into trust by the U.S. for the benefit of the 19 Pueblos. (c) In 2004, the Pueblo de San Ildefonso, as a joint owner of the SFIS Trust Lands, delegated its authority on all matters related to the governance, operation and administration of the SFIS Trust Lands to the SFIS, Inc. and its Board of Trustees, the entity also responsible for educational functions of the Santa Fe Indian School. (d) In 2010, out of concern that the SFIS, Inc. was focusing on the development of the SFIS Trust Lands rather than on the educational mission of the SFIS, the Pueblo Council rescinded its 2004 resolution that granted broad governance authority to the SFIS Board of Trustees, and by its 2010 resolution, limited the delegation of Pueblo's governance authority to SFIS, Inc. (e) In 2012, the Governors continued to raise concerns that economic development and governance of the SFIS Trust Lands was taking priority over education, and the SFIS Inc. Board of Trustees committed to the separation of educational functions of the School and economic development projects on the SFIS Trust Lands, and further committed to work with the 19 Pueblo Governors and their Tribal Councils before proceeding with any change in governance activity. (f) In 2015, at the request of SFIS, Inc., the Pueblo passed Resolution No. SI-R15-015 to grant limited governance authority to the SFIS, Inc. to enter into agreements for emergency response situations and to address specific land management issues since those authorities had been rescinded by the Pueblo in 2010. (g) In 2016, after a thorough evaluation of the need to separate governance authority for the SFIS Trust Lands and the educational authority for the SFIS, and at the request of SFIS, Inc., the Pueblo passed Resolution No. SI-R16-005 which rescinded its two prior resolutions, SI-R10-040 and SI-R15-015, and delegated the Pueblo's governance authority over the SFIS Trust Lands to the Albuquerque Indian School District (\"AISD\") Governing Council. (h) The Council determined that it was in the best interest of the Pueblo and SFIS to delegate the Pueblo's authority over the SFIS Trust Lands to its Governor when sitting on the AISD Governing Council so that Governors are making governance decisions for the SFIS Trust Lands, thus keeping educational matters separate and allowing the Board of Trustees to focus on the educational and operational activities of the SFIS. (i) All of the 19 Pueblos passed similar resolutions that delegated their Governor the governance authority over the SFIS Trust Lands when sitting as the AISD Governing Council. (j) Despite the directive of this Pueblo's Tribal Council, and the other 18 Pueblo Tribal Councils, to move governance to the AISD Governing Council, the SFIS Board of Trustees took actions that the Council believes are contrary to the directives of this Pueblo's delegation resolution. (k) The Council determines that it is in the best interest of the Pueblo as a joint owner of the SFIS Trust Lands, to now rescind its Resolution No. SI-R16-005, that delegated authority to the AISD Governing Council for the SFIS Trust Lands, and for the Pueblo to reassume and reserve the Pueblo's governance authority over the SFIS Trust Lands. (l) The Council determines that it is in the best interest of the Pueblo, as an owner of the SFIS, as well as the SFIS students, that the SFIS, Inc. Board of Trustees focus on the educational and operational functions of the SFIS. New &lt;a class=\"no-wrap\" href=\"/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/2.3.9.050\"&gt;Section 2.3.9.050&lt;/a&gt; Section 1.5. Governance Authority on SFIS Trust Lands (a) The Council hereby rescinds Pueblo de San Ildefonso Council Resolution No. SI-R16-005, adopted on May 13, 2016, in its entirety and such resolution shall have no force and effect. (b) The Council reassumes and reserves to itself all of the Pueblo's governance authority over the SFIS Trust Lands. (c) The SFIS, Inc. Board of Trustees is directed to present any matters relating to governance of the SFIS Trust Lands to the Council for direction and approval. New &lt;a class=\"no-wrap\" href=\"/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/2.3.9.060\"&gt;Section 2.3.9.060&lt;/a&gt; Section 1.6. Delegation of Educational Authority (a) The Council delegates the Pueblo's authority to the SFIS, Inc. Board of Trustees to the educational and operational functions of the SFIS. (b) This delegation of educational authority does not extend to a change in the educational or organizational structure of the SFIS, or amendment of the Santa Fe Indian School Act.

{"body": "Resolution No. SI-R17-036: Supporting a Strong 2018 Farm Bill for Indian Country At a duly called meeting of the Council of San Ildefonso Pueblo on the 31st day of October , 2017, the following Resolution was adopted: New &lt;a class=\"no-wrap\" href=\"/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/2.2.4.010\"&gt;Section 2.2.4.010&lt;/a&gt; WHEREAS, the Pueblo de San Ildefonso (\"Pueblo\") is a sovereign and self-governing Tribe, recognized as such by the United States of America, with the authority to govern its people, lands and other resources; and WHEREAS, the U.S. Congress is deliberating on the nature of food and agriculture policy for the nation and the world, as it must reauthorize the multi-year Farm Bill in 2018 which governs all farm programs, rural development, and nutrition initiatives within the U.S. Department of Agriculture; and WHEREAS, agriculture is among the largest economic development industries in Indian Country, providing $3.4 billion per year; and the policies that provide the framework for Indian Country's agriculture production constitute a large portion of the Farm Bill; and WHEREAS, an overwhelming majority of the land throughout Indian Country is involved in agriculture production and many tribal citizens live in rural areas and communities where the cost of building or repairing basic infrastructure systems are often prohibitively high, and the 2018 Farm Bill will provide an authorization of federal funding for rural infrastructure initiatives; and WHEREAS, tribal citizens and members in rural areas are often afflicted by poverty of place, wherein they are unable to find suitable employment to provide adequate income that supports good nutrition for their families; and thus, may rely on federal nutrition programs authorized in the Farm Bill; and WHEREAS, even with the great strides made for Indian Country agriculture in previous Farm Bill negotiations, going virtually unmentioned in the 1990s to many thoughtful provisions scattered across all Titles, the $3.4 billion generated annually through Indian agricultural efforts is still more than 99 percent raw commodities, instead of the healthy, local, economically beneficial, and nutritious food needed in Indian Country communities and rural areas; and WHEREAS, the 2018 Farm Bill negotiations, resulting policies, and funding must continue to include and incorporate perspectives from Indian Country to afford parity, opportunity, and consistency under the federal food and agriculture laws, policies, and programs; and WHEREAS, improving programs and funding for Indian Country will help to ensure Tribal governments have the ability to establish long-term plans and goals for their communities and the surrounding rural communities, and help Native farmers and ranchers continue to grow their food businesses and build tribal food systems to support our economies and communities; and WHEREAS, the 2018 Farm Bill effort being promoted by the Native Farm Bill Coalition is the best opportunity in decades for Indian Country to effectively create positive and truly relevant change in federal agriculture policy to enhance the development of Indian agriculture beyond raw commodities, support infrastructure, research, and education in tribal communities, and improve federal food nutrition programs in Indian Country while providing tribal governments the authority manage these programs.

{"body": "Resolution No. SI-R17-035: Investment Funds Management Act of 2017 At a duly called meeting of the Council of San Ildefonso Pueblo on the 31st day of October , 2017, the following Resolution was adopted: WHEREAS, the Pueblo de San Ildefonso (\"Pueblo\") is a sovereign and self-governing Tribe, recognized as such by the United States of America, with the authority to govern its people, lands and other resources; and WHEREAS, the Pueblo has operated its government in a fiscally prudent manner and has, over the years, developed an sizeable investment fund (\"Investment Fund\"), currently about $24,000,000.00, for the benefit of the People and the Pueblo's long-term financial health; and, WHEREAS, the Pueblo's Investment Fund is currently invested 100% in stocks, thereby exposing the Pueblo to a high level of risk due to the volatility of the stock market; and, WHEREAS, the Pueblo recently hired a highly-qualified, independent expert, Dr. Cohen of Portfolio Monitoring, LLC, to review and analyze the Investment Fund, and Dr. Cohen has concluded that in a typical down-turn in the stock market (based on historical and other factors) the Pueblo could reasonably expect to lose about one-third of the value of the Investment Fund; and, WHEREAS, Dr. Cohen recently conducted an in-depth review of the Investment Fund and the practices of the current investment advisor, San Francisco Sentry, and has discovered several weaknesses in the advisor's investment practices including underperforming the benchmark and improper reporting; and, WHEREAS, the Tribe recently hired a well-qualified and experienced Controller who has also reviewed and analyzed the Pueblo's Investment Fund and investment practices, and concurs with the Dr. Cohen's conclusions and findings; and, WHEREAS, the Council has determined that the Pueblo's current investment practices expose the Investment Fund to unnecessary risk based on the volatility of the stock market and the lack of diversification, which could result in a significant loss to the Pueblo; and, WHEREAS, based on the recommendations of the Tribe's expert advisors, the Council and Governor have concluded that the Investment Fund should be separated into three different accounts with one account invested in bonds, a safer investment, one account invested for long-term growth, and one account of managed investments, thereby lowering the risk of loss, but still generating a reasonable income; and, WHEREAS, the Council and Governor have also determined that transferring the Investment Fund assets to two highly qualified and sophisticated investment companies, Morgan Stanley (\"Morgan Stanley\") and Rockefeller Asset Management (\"Rockefeller\"), that charge reasonable fees, will establish further safeguards for the Pueblo's Investment Fund; and, WHEREAS, the Pueblo will also continue to utilize the services of Portfolio Monitoring, LLC, as a cost-effective, extra level of protection of the Investment Fund and will utilize such services until expiration of their contract and/or renewal of the contract; and, WHEREAS, the Council has also determined that the Pueblo's current investment guidelines (\"Investment Guidelines\") that dictate the permissible investment practices are inadequate; and, WHEREAS, based on the advice of the Pueblo's experts, the Council and Governor have determined that the Investment Guidelines should be revised to reflect a more realistic approach towards reaching the investment goals of the Pueblo. WHEREAS, the Governor and Council have reviewed the status of the reserve fund, with the assistance of an independent expert, and have determined that it is in the best interest of the Pueblo to diversify the investments of the Pueblo into safer investments to minimize the risk of loss of the Pueblo's funds.

Purpose The purpose of this Act is to confirm that the Pueblo de San Ildefonso does not need to be a party in the lawsuit between the Pueblo of Jemez and the United States regarding the Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title in the Valles Caldera and that the lawsuit can proceed without San Ildefonso Pueblo's participation. New &lt;a class=\"no-wrap\" href=\"/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/2.3.8.030\"&gt;Section 2.3.8.030&lt;/a&gt; Section 1.3. Findings The Council hereby finds and declares that: (a) The Pueblo of Jemez has filed a lawsuit against the United States in a case captioned Pueblo of Jemez v. United States of America , No. 12-cv-0800 RB/SMV (the \"Jemez Lawsuit\"), asking the United States District Court to declare that the Pueblo of Jemez has the exclusive right to use, occupy and possess certain lands in the Valles Caldera based on the Pueblo of Jemez's continuing aboriginal Indian title to those lands, and asking the court to quiet the Pueblo's aboriginal Indian title to the lands. (b) The Pueblo of Jemez has continuously used and occupied its aboriginal lands in the Jemez Mountains, including the area now encompassed by the Valles Caldera National Preserve, for traditional and nontraditional purposes pursuant to the Pueblo's aboriginal Indian title from time immemorial to the present. (c) In 1860 the United States Congress authorized the heirs of Luis Maria Cabeza de Baca to select lands within the then New Mexico Territory in settlement of the heirs' Spanish land grant claim in the vicinity of Las Vegas, New Mexico. (d) The United States and the Pueblo of Santa Clara purchased the 1860 American land grant title to the Baca Location No. 1 from the Dunnigan Family on July 25, 2000 to create the Valles Caldera National Preserve and to add lands to the Santa Clara Reservation. (e) At all times the lands aboriginally used by the Pueblo de San Ildefonso within the Valles Caldera National Preserve have remained subject to the valid aboriginal Indian title of the Pueblo of Jemez, which title has never been abandoned or terminated. (f) It is not customary for the family of Pueblos, to solve or seek to solve any differences of traditional or cultural matters we might have with other Pueblos using the American court system, but instead rely on traditional and informal agreements between them to address such issues. (g) The Pueblo de San Ildefonso and the Pueblo of Jemez have reached agreement as tribal sovereigns regarding their respective traditional cultural activities and spiritual uses and in particular, on arrangements as regards the traditional cultural activities and spiritual uses of the Pueblo de San Ildefonso within the Valles Caldera. (h) The Pueblo de San Ildefonso does not need to be a party to the Jemez Lawsuit against the United States to protect its interests. (i) The Court can accord complete relief among existing parties without the Pueblo de San Ildefonso being a party to the Jemez Lawsuit. (j) The United States, both as a party defendant and as the trustee owing fiduciary obligations to the Pueblo people, should not be allowed to pit one Pueblo against another to avoid addressing the aboriginal title of the Pueblo of Jemez to the lands at issue in the Jemez Lawsuit. (k) The United States recently announced its support of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and Article 26, paragraph 1 of the Declaration states that \"indigenous peoples have the right to the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired.\" (l) The Pueblo de San Ildefonso is not so situated that disposing of the Jemez Lawsuit without the Pueblo de San Ildefonso being in the lawsuit may or would, as a practical matter, impair or impede our ability to protect any interest the Pueblo de San Ildefonso has. (m) The Pueblo de San Ildefonso staying out of the lawsuit would not leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of any interest our Pueblo has or might have.

Purpose The purpose of this Act is to clarify the process for members of the Pueblo de San Ildefonso (\"Pueblo\") to become home owners, and to authorize the Governor to execute and deliver necessary documents to transfer and certify property interests within the Pueblo. New &lt;a class=\"no-wrap\" href=\"/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/15.2.1.030\"&gt;Section 15.2.1.030&lt;/a&gt; Section 1.3. Findings The Council hereby finds and declares that the current process for members of the Pueblo to obtain ownership of a home through the Northern Pueblo Housing Authority (\"NPHA\") includes the following: (a) The Pueblo identifies a vacant parcel of land; (b) The Pueblo enters into a lease (the \"NPHA Lease\") with the Northern Pueblos Housing Authority, a federally recognized Tribally Designated Housing Entity (\"NPHA\") holding authorization from the Pueblos of Picuris, San Ildefonso and Tesuque tribes to obtain and manage Indian Housing Block Grant Program (\"IHBG\") funding from HUD covering the parcel of land on the Pueblo's reservation where the house is to be located (the \"Subject Parcel\"), recognizing that, at times, the NPHA lease may cover several parcels (a \"master lease\"); (c) Since the Subject Parcel is on the Pueblo's reservation, which is held in trust for the Pueblo by the US Government, the Subject Parcel is subject to federal law; (d) As provided by federal law, the NPHA lease between the Pueblo and the NPHA can only have a maximum term of 50 years (25 year initial term and a second 25 year term); At the end of the 50 year term, title to the Subject Parcel reverts to the Pueblo; (e) Using IHBG funding or other funds, the NPHA builds a house on the Subject Parcel covered by the NPHA Lease; (f) Because the NPHA is the lessee under the NPHA Lease, the NPHA, as lessee, owns the house (because the house is attached to the land, if the NPHA Lease did not exist, the house would belong to the Pueblo); (g) NPHA enters into an \"Occupancy Agreement\" with a member of the Pueblo (the \"Acquiring Member\") whereby the Acquiring Member: (1) obtains immediate right to occupy the house; and, (2) if the Acquiring Member performs certain obligations over a specific term of time, the Acquiring Member will acquire the rights the NPHA has in the house; (h) Currently, when the Acquiring Member fully performs under the Occupancy Agreement, the NPHA transfers to the Acquiring Member all of the NPHA's right, title and interest in the house in the form of a quit claim deed; (i) The problem with the current arrangement is that although the NPHA is transferring all of its rights as lessee under the NPHA Lease to the Acquiring Member, the NPHA Lease only gives the NPHA the right to occupy the parcel for a maximum of 50 years; (j) The Pueblo wants the Acquiring Member to be able to occupy and treat the house as his or hers for a period of time longer than the term of the NPHA Lease; (k) In order to correct the situation, the process needs to be changed to provide that, when the Acquiring Member fully performs under the Occupancy Agreement: (1) the NPHA gives up all rights it has in the parcel and the house (this would require a quit claim deed between the NPHA and the Pueblo for the Subject Parcel); and (2) the Pueblo would immediately give the Acquiring Member an assignment covering the house and the land on which it is located; (l) There is also an issue as to whether the Pueblo's Governor had the legal authority from the Council to grant the right to occupy specific houses to previous Acquiring Members who had fully and completely performed under the Occupancy Agreement. New &lt;a class=\"no-wrap\" href=\"/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/15.2.1.040\"&gt;Section 15.2.1.040&lt;/a&gt; Section 1.4. Authorization and Ratification of the Governor's Authority to Execute Various Housing Documents (a) Upon written notification to the Governor from the NPHA and the Pueblo's Realty Office that an Acquiring Member has fully performed under his or her Occupancy Agreement, the Governor shall take any and all steps to confirm that the Acquiring Member is in good standing with the Pueblo, the NPHA, and the Occupancy Agreement. (b) If the Governor determines that the Acquiring Member is in good standing with the Pueblo, the NPHA, and the Occupancy Agreement, the Governor shall: (1) Accept a quit claim deed for the house from the NPHA substantially in the form attached hereto, as may be revised from time to time in conjunction with the NPHA; and, (2) Execute and deliver to the Acquiring Member a Certificate of Land Assignment covering the subject parcel and house substantially in the form attached hereto, as may be revised from time to time in conjunction with the Pueblo's Realty Office and the NPHA. (c) If the Governor does not receive confirmation that the Acquiring Member is in good standing with the Pueblo, the NPHA, and the Occupancy Agreement, the Governor shall so notify the Acquiring Member and the Acquiring Member may obtain review of the matter as provided by the Agreement and laws of the Pueblo. (d) All previous transfers of houses to Acquiring Members (including by quit claim deed or assignment) executed by the current and any previous Governors since 2012 are hereby ratified and confirmed ab initio provided, that the Acquiring Member was in good standing with the Pueblo, the NPHA as confirmed in writing by the NPHA, and the Occupancy Agreement as of the date of transfer.", "num": "SI-R17-014", "path": "library|us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/resolutions|2017|Pueblo de San Ildefonso Council Res.

Purpose The purpose of this Act is to acknowledge receipt of the boundary survey prepared by surveyor Larry Medrano of Precision Surveys, Inc.

Medrano of Precision Surveys, Inc. to conduct a boundary survey of certain areas of the Pueblo's lands, including the area known as El Rancho. (b) The Medrano Boundary Survey, as presented on the date of this enactment, is fundamentally complete except for the area located in the El Rancho area referred to as the Duran area where Precision Surveys, Inc. crews were denied access by the private landowners. (c) Any recording of the Medrano Boundary Survey would note that access was denied to the Duran area, and if the area is surveyed by Precision Surveys, Inc. at a later date, the Medrano Boundary Survey can be amended to reflect the newly surveyed areas.

(e) The recording, filing, and/or delivery of the Medrano Boundary Survey with appropriate entities such as the Santa Fe County Clerk's Office or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, etc., serves as public notice of the Pueblo's boundaries and puts other surveyors on notice of the findings and conclusions regarding the Pueblo's boundaries contained in the Medrano Boundary Survey. (f) The Council finds it in the best interest of the Pueblo to acknowledge receipt of the Medrano Boundary Survey, provided that it may be amended at a later date to include survey information from the Duran area, and to authorize recording of the amended survey with such appropriate public entities as deemed necessary by the Governor to protect the Pueblo's property rights.

Short Title This enactment shall be known as the \"ACT AUTHORIZING LOCATION OF WATER TREATMENT PLANT AS PART OF AAMODT WATER RIGHTS SETTLEMENT(\"Act\").\" Section 1.2. Purpose The purpose of this Act is to authorize the location of the water treatment plant within the Pueblo de San Ildefonso's (\"Pueblo\") lands as part of the implementation of the water rights settlement agreement in the federal water adjudication case of State v. Aamodt , U.S. District Court of New Mexico, No. 66CV6639 (\"Aamodt case\"). Section 1.3. Findings The Council hereby finds and declares that: (a) The Pueblo is a party in the federal water adjudication case of State v. Aamodt . (b) As part of the implementation of the Aamodt Settlement, a regional water system will be constructed by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (\"BOR\"), with the primary intake and treatment facilities for the system being located on Pueblo lands. (c) On December 22, 2016, BOR requested that the Pueblo approve a location for the water treatment plant and identified three (3) potential locations as follows: 1. 101D East \u2013 located on the east side of 101D south of electric substation (Location A); 2. 101 West \u2013 located on the west side of 101D across from the electric substation (Location B); 3. Highway 502 \u2013 located at the northwest side of intersection of Highway 502 and 101D (Location C). (d) The Council had previously authorized a site, identified herein as Location A, as the preferred site pursuant to Council Resolution SI-R13-005. (e) In its December 22, 2016 letter, the BOR identified issues with the locations as summarized follows: 1. Location A lies within a flood zone, is restrictive in size, will require relocation of power poles and substantial fill material to level the site. 2. Location B will require relocation of some power poles and will require excavation of the hill at the site. 3. Location C is the preferred location of BOR because it requires no excavation or relocation of power poles. (f) Traditional leaders of the Pueblo have been informed of BOR's recommendation and have toured the potential locations, along with several Council Representatives. (g) In consultation with the Traditional leaders, the Council has evaluated all of the locations and determined that: 1. Location C is not acceptable for the treatment plant site because it will limit the Pueblo's future economic development at that location, but may be used as a temporary construction staging area for the regional water system; and 2. Location A is not acceptable because it lies within a flood zone and due to other restrictions; and 3. Location B is the most favorable location because of the limitations of the other proposed sites, and that excavated material from Location B can be sold for use in the construction of the regional water system. (h) The Council has determined that it is in the best interest of the Pueblo to rescind SI-R13-005 relating to the previous preferred location, and to now approve Location B as the site for the location for the water treatment facility for the Pojoaque Basin Regional Water System. Section 1.4. Authorizations (a) SI-R13-005 is hereby rescinded. (b) The Council hereby authorizes the Governor to notify the BOR that the Council has authorized the Governor to select Location B as the site for the location for the water treatment facility for the Pojoaque Basin Regional Water System.", "num": "SI-R17-005", "path": "library|us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/resolutions|2017|Pueblo de San Ildefonso Council Res.

Irene Tse-Pe, Council Secretary PUEBLO DE SAN ILDEFONSO ACT AUTHORIZING SIGNATURE OF JOINT POWERS AGREEMENT AS PART OF AAMODT WATER RIGHTS SETTLEMENT Section 1.1. Short Title This enactment shall be known as the \"ACT AUTHORIZING SIGNATURE OF JOINT POWERS AGREEMENT AS PART OF AAMODT WATER RIGHTS SETTLEMENT (\"Act\").\" Section 1.2. Purpose The purpose of this Act is to authorize the Governor to sign the Joint Powers Agreement (\"JPA\") which is a part of the implementation of the water rights settlement agreement in the federal water adjudication case of State v. Aamodt , U.S. District Court of New Mexico, No. 66CV6639 (\"Aamodt case\"). Section 1.3. Findings The Council hereby finds and declares that: (a) The Pueblo de San Ildefonso is a party in the federal water adjudication case of State v. Aamodt . (b) In 2010, the United States enacted 1the Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act, as part of the Claims Resolution Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 11-291, Title VI, \u00a7\u00a7 601-626, 124 Stat. 3064, 3134-56 (2010), which was signed into law by the President on December 8, 2010 (\"Settlement Act\" or \"Act\"). (c) The parties revised the Settlement Agreement (April 19, 2012) (\"Revised Agreement\") to reflect the terms of the Settlement Act, prepared Waivers consistent with the Act and completed the Cost Sharing and System Integration Agreement (\"CSSIA\") as required by the Act. (d) The Council after due consideration approved the Revised Agreement, the Waivers and the CSSIA on behalf of the Pueblo in Resolution NO. SI-R12-035. (e) The four Pueblos of Namb\u00e9, Pojoaque, San Ildefonso and Tesuque that are parties to the Aamodt case signed the Settlement Agreement conformed to the Act on March 14, 2013, together with the other four governments affected by the Act. (f) Section 9.5 of the Settlement Agreement requires the four Pueblos and Santa Fe County (\"County\") to create the Pojoaque Basin Regional Water Authority (\"Regional Water Authority\") prior to Entry of the Final Decree in accordance with the provisions of the Settlement Agreement and the August 27, 2009 Cost-Sharing and System Integration Agreement (Cost-Sharing Agreement) signed by the United States, the State, the four Pueblos, the County, and the City. (g) Since 2013, the four Pueblos negotiated with the County to develop terms for a JPA to establish a Regional Water Authority to operate the Pojoaque Basin Regional Water System which the United States is building as required by the Settlement Act. (h) The Pueblo had previously approved a form of the JPA which was later revised as a result of on-going negotiations between the parties. (i) The Pueblo de San Ildefonso, as one of the four NPTWRA Pueblos, negotiated in good faith certain terms with Santa Fe County representatives in April 2016, but the County later disagreed with the negotiated terms, and after several meetings with the four Pueblos, including several public meetings, proposed terms different than those previously negotiated with the NPTWRA Pueblos. Despite the Pueblos' opposition, Santa Fe County adopted its proposed terms at a meeting on December 13, 2016. (j) On December 13, 2016, Santa Fe County by Resolution No. 2016-146 approved the form of the JPA. (k) Article 19(H) of the proposed JPA requires the respective Pueblo and County governing bodies to adopt resolutions approving the JPA, \"including the limited waiver of sovereign immunity provided therein.\" (l) Action on the JPA by the individual Tribal Councils of the Pueblos of Namb\u00e9, Pojoaque, San Ildefonso, and Tesuque on the JPA is needed in order to create the Regional Water Authority. (m) The Council, having reviewed a form of the Joint Powers Agreement, and despite the concern about the changed terms by Santa Fe County, finds approval of the Joint Powers Agreement, which includes a limited waiver of the Pueblo's sovereign immunity, is in the best interest of this Pueblo and in the interest of moving the Aamodt Settlement forward. Section 1.4. Authorizations (a) The Governor is hereby authorized to sign a form of the Joint Powers Agreement, that also includes the limited waiver of sovereign immunity provided in Article 19(H), in coordination with the other three Pueblos and Santa Fe County. (b) The Governor is authorized to make any minor technical non-substantive amendments to the Joint Powers Agreement document as may be necessary, provided that the Council is informed of such amendments. (c) This Act supersedes any previous resolutions pertaining to Council approval of a prior form of the Joint Powers Agreement.", "num": "SI-R17-004", "path": "library|us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/resolutions|2017|Pueblo de San Ildefonso Council Res.
